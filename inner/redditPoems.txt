This is only a tree

I will not tell you

it has a beautiful spirit.

I advise you to believe

nature carries no importance.

It is impossible to say

We should not just build over top it.

It's simply horrid.

Imagine a less natural world.

Imagine a place strictly manmade.

Beautiful, isn't it?

It's just a tree.

Because I thought I was SO CLEVER, huh?

Well fuck you.


I don't expect a girl that cooks,

Or reads the smartest, arty books,

Or wows the world with wondrous looks,

So long as she's not Nicki Minaj.


Her nose would be so slightly bent,

Her wage would barely cover rent,

She'd be not quite from heaven sent,

But more importantly, not be Nicki Minaj.


Her poise and habits might be strange,

Her mind would rank in middle range,

Her flaws should seldom ever change,

Unless they include 'being Nicki Minaj'.


Beauty doesn't mean a thing,

Nor shape, nor wealth, nor clothes, nor bling,

She wouldn't need to dance or sing,

Especially not as poorly as Nicki Minaj.


She'd never be the very best,

With hair unmessed, or fans impressed,

Nor blessed with excess breast on chest,

But at least she wouldn't be Nicki Minaj.


My ideal girl might seem a bore,

But why insist on so much more?

She's not that short, annoying whore,

Called Nicki Minaj.


(I don't like Nicki Minaj)

Still drunk
And crawled silently into bed.
I hadn't slept.
I had spent all night waiting for her.
I was now taking shirts off hangers.

Later she woke and dressed.
She was meeting a friend in Santa Barbara
Two hours away.

She saw my things.
Folded, pressed, and snapped shut.
She knew.

She put her arms around me
But all I could feel were bones
And they were small and shaking.

""I love you more than I've ever loved anyone.""
""I know, sweetheart.""

We kissed and she left.

The afternoon sun retreated.
I stood in the apartment in silence.

I shaved my head and my face.
I showered.
I toweled my feet dry before stepping out.
She had always scolded me
For leaving puddles behind
So this time I didn't
Even though she'd never know.

I fixed the towels on the rail.
Even an act as simple as that carries weight
When it's the last time.

I broke down and cried
Harder than I had in years
Remembering the boy and the girl
With two pet rabbits and barely a bed
That had moved into that space a year ago.

I looked for reasons to not leave,
There were unwashed plates, and drawers ajar.
A bowl full of limes sat on the counter.
I had taken care choosing those
And now they would rot or be eaten
Either way, without me.

I turned the key in the lock.
It caught loudly.
I stood still, trying to remember its sound.

Then I boarded this bus,
And wrote this for you.
and fall to the ground
in emotional madness.


Dear friends, neighbors and distant relations,
we hereby extend our sincere salutations.
You've now received one of several invitations
to a party with friends, games, and decorations!

It's Calvin's 4th birthday, you'll be happy to hear,
and he'd like you to watch as he ages a year.
He might grow a foot, though probably not,
as three feet are one more than most people got.
He might sound all deep, like a grown man might be,
but I think he'll just sound like when he was three.
He might grow a beard, like a real mountain man,
Or flash his gold teeth and a seasonal tan.
He might drive a car, or pilot a plane.
He might be so old that he'll need a cane!
One thing's for sure, and is plain as can be.
Calvin's turning four, and will no longer be three.

So please join us for what needs no explanations,
no allegorical, metaphorical, categorical complications,
no borin' or foreign or complex translations,

that in the thesaurus,

a synonym for “the world”

is dust.



It takes you twice as long

to fill the tea kettle.

Water sloshing over the side,

pouring over the cold metal,

and you tell me,

“I would be a pianist

if I had steady hands.”



You wake up beside me,

with your head in your hands,

your battered knees shaking

and you ask me,

“Since when are the nights

so long?”



I come home one day,

you are crying on the floor.

And you are doused in gasoline

and your hair is soaked in oil

and you tell me,

“I couldn’t find

after one long year

To me she is always the same.
“I love you” she says, in her soft gentle voice
But she doesn’t remember my name.

Our pace is quite slow as we traverse the hall
(Her left foot has now become lame)
She smiles as she lovingly touches my arm
But she doesn’t remember my name.

""I’d like to go home with you,"" she often says
As somehow my heart fills with shame
She wants to leave and go home with me even
Though she doesn’t remember my name

So, here we are, in a crisis of time
Valiantly playing life’s game.
I squeeze her hand and she squeezes mine back
But she doesn’t remember my name.

The time we have left seems so horribly short;
Yet, there is one thing I can claim—
There will come a time we’re together again,
And I know she’ll remember my name.

— Charles H. Duncan

You would always whisper,

""God doesn't need us,"" but

your mouth tasted like

holy wine, skin like the

paperthin wafers they

lay on your tongue at church.


You find divine revelation

at the bottom of whisky bottles,

carry your baby teeth in

your pocket like rosary beads.


Jeremiah told his people

to roll themselves in ashes and

mourn for Nineveh's demise,

but you are steeped

in selferosion,

covered in the soot of

your own decay.


A woman outside the grocery store

handed you a bible and told you

that Jesus died for our sins;

you flicked your cigarette onto

the concrete and said, ""I'm about

to die for my own.""


When you wept at night,

when you thought

I couldn't hear, you

cried out ""oh god, oh god""

like something had pulled

your heart up

by the roots.




but midway through

the pastor’s melancholy

speech, my mind drifts

to that time you streaked

down Elm Street shouting

to the late night world

that you were free.


A burst of laughter

escapes my mouth

and all eyes find me.


Stuck in that box,

you are again as free

as a nudist,

but I’m just the guy

who laughs at a

funeral.
That's what he said, at least.
So here I am,
in my living room
with an absolute stranger sitting across from me.

He hasn't said a word but
""I'm looking for a bed to die in.""
His face is weathered, worn, and torn.
His body trembles
as if the ground beneath him were imploding.
His eyes are black.
His skin is grey.

I ask him if I could get him help.
If he wanted help.
How he knew he was going to die.
His face remained blank.
Empty eyes staring back at me.
Nothing on his face as he repeats
""I'm looking for a bed to die in.""

I pause, now. I want him to leave.
My body groans from the pressure.
The burden of death shakes me to my core.

""Please, sir, you have to have a family.""
Nothing. I wonder if he has dementia.
""Friends?""
Nothing. I wonder if he has already died.
""A wife?""

Then I feel it. The earth imploding beneath my feet.
I feel the weight on my hands as I tried to lift them.
I feel my lungs collapsing.
There was not enough air to talk. Only speak.
Fire didn't roar through his eyes
yet I could feel heat careening off his body towards me.
Mountains grew and shrank.

""I've loved,""
he said
""But she never loved me. ""

I could think of nothing to say.
My eyes didn't well with tears.
I didnt weep for him.
I took him to my bed.
The bed for him to die in.

“Please, sir, you have to have a family.”
Nothing. I wonder if he is crazy.
“Friends?”
Nothing. I wonder if he is already dead.
“A wife?”

Then I feel it.
The earth imploding beneath my feet.

“Don’t fall in love with a curious one.
They will look through your photographs and read all of your poems.
They will ask you to rant when you’re angry and cry when you’re hurt.
They will ask what that raised eyebrow meant.
They will ask why.c c
They’ll learn to cook your favorite meals.
The curious people don’t settle for your shell, they want the insides.
for joy, and anger, and heartbreak.
Their skin will turn into pages
that you learn to pour out your entire being in.
Don’t fall in love with the curious one.
They won’t let a sigh go unexplained.
They will want to know what they did.
Exactly what they did to make you love them.
Year, month, week, day.
“What time was it? What did I say? What did I do?
How did you feel?”
Don’t fall in love with a curious one because I’ve been there.
They will unbutton your shirtand read every scar     every mark
every curve.
They will dissect your every limb, every organ, every thought, every being
then walk back home and eat their dinner and never return your calls.
You will never be their lifelong expedition.
The heart is a mystery only for so long.
There is no ache like loving a curious one
who chases every falling star and never catching one.
Who comes and sees and conquers
and leaves.
I’ve fallen in love with a curious one.
Maybe one day he will take the train back home
and be curious enough to read one last message from me    carved on a seat.
“There’s a curiosity in you that will move mountains some day

that once you become a woman,

they rip your heart out

and put in a clock instead.


Counting:

sixty seconds a minute,

sixty minutes an hour,

until your worth runs out

with your youth.


They never tell you

what it feels like,

not even being able to get on the subway

without some guy

checking out your ass,

even though the government

says you’re too young

to buy alcohol.


They never tell you that out there,

the word “sensitive"" is an insult;

out there, shame is something even Chanel no. 5

can’t cover up.


They never tell you that by the time you find a boy

to love, taking off your clothes will be like

taking off bandages,

like peeling off

sunburnt skin.


That your body

will always come with

strings attached, that this world

is trench warfare

and you are just a foot soldier.


That some days you’ll feel

like a broken vase

everyone keeps trying

to stick flowers in.


You are not Schrodinger’s cat.

You are not beautiful or ugly

only until someone tells you so.


But they don’t teach you that

in high school.


When you want to tell the guy on the bus

to go fuck himself

because he won’t leave you alone,

you’ll bite your tongue instead

and swallow your words,

collecting them underneath your ribcage:

a hornet’s nest buzzing below your heart,

reminding it not to feel too much

or beat too hard.


And you’ll see him again the next day:

same time, same place,

with his hand

up a girl’s skirt


and the sun will still be out



What if I do not like bows?

For that matter,

What if I do not enjoy boxes?



What if,

I’ve a multicoloured bubble for my home;

for my heart.

Slick with the passion of youth;

exuberance, joy and creation?



A web, perchance,

both sturdy and orderly.

Maybe poorly placed,

high up in an oak tree.



If a bird were to snap a strand,

would you panic;

gather me up, and

figure me for a square peg?



I’m not supposed to make sense.

Not at the core of me.

This swirling,

cloudlike mess of colour and dreams;

of reality and fantasy.



Humanity.



Neapolitan humanity.

Not vanilla, chocolate or strawberry alone,

though enjoyable nonetheless.



Unless,

you’re a sherbert kind of person.



Don’t sear my side to make me fit.

Don’t give me sides to sear.



Lean a little.

Watch how I plant my roots contrary to your sun.


Why would you force your light upon me,

when I can already breathe?


'cause laying back and getting high was all he cared to do.

As a kid, he sat in the cellar, sniffing airplane glue.
And then he smoked banana peels, when that was the thing to do.
He tried aspirin in CocaCola, he breathed helium on the sly,
and his life became an endless search to find the perfect high.

But grass just made him wanna lay back and eat chocchip pizza all night,
Speed made him wanna rap all day, reds laid him too far back,
CocaineRose was sweet to his nose, but the price nearly broke his back.

He tried PCP, he tried THC, but they never quite did the trick.
Poppers nearly blew his heart, and mushrooms made him sick.
Acid made him see the light, but he couldn't remember it long.
Hash was a little too weak, and smack was a lot too strong.
Quaaludes made him stumble, booze just made him cry,
Then he heard of a cat named Baba Fats who knew of the perfect high.

Now, Baba Fats was a hermit cat, lived high up in Nepal,
On a craggy mountain top, up a sheer and icy wall.
""Well, hell!"" says Roy, ""I'm a healthy boy, and I'll crawl or climb or fly,
Till I find that guru who'll give me a clue as to what's the perfect high.""

So out and off goes GimmeSomeRoy, to the land that knows no time,
Up a trail no man could conquer, to a cliff no man could climb.
For fourteen years he climbed that cliff, back down again he'd slide,
He'd sit and cry, then climb some more, pursuing the perfect high.

Grinding his teeth, coughing blood, aching and shaking and weak,
Starving and sore, bleeding and tore, he reaches the mountain peak.
As there in repose, and wearing no clothes, sits the godlike Baba Fats.

""What's happenin', Fats?"" says Roy with joy, ""I've come to state my biz...
I hear you're hip to the perfect trip, please tell me what it is.
""For you can see,"" says Roy to he, ""I'm about to die,
So for my last ride, tell me, how can I achieve the perfect high?""

""Well, dog my cats!"" says Baba Fats. ""Another burned out soul,
Who's lookin' for an alchemist to turn his trip to gold.
It isn't in a dealer's stash, or on a druggist's shelf...
Son, if you would find the perfect high, you'd find it in yourself.""

""Why, you jive motherfucker!"" says Roy, ""I climbed through rain and sleet,
I froze three fingers off my hands, and four toes off my feet!
I braved the lair of the polar bear, I've tasted the maggot's kiss.
Now, you tell me the high is in myself? What kinda shit is this?

My ears, before they froze off,"" says Roy, ""had heard all kindsa crap;
But I didn't climb for fourteen years to hear your sophomore rap.
And I didn't climb up here to hear that the high is on the natch,
So you tell me where the real stuff is, or I'll kill your guru ass!""

""Okay...okay,"" says Baba Fats, ""You're forcin' it outta me...
There is a land beyond the sun that's known as Zabolee.
A wretched land of stone and sand, where snakes and buzzards scream,
And in this devil's garden blooms the mystic Tzutzu tree.

Now, once every ten years it blooms one flower, as white as the Key West sky,
And he who eats of the Tzutzu flower shall know the perfect high.
For the rush comes on like a tidal wave...hits like the blazin' sun.
And the high? It lasts forever, and the down don't never come.

But Zabolee Land is ruled by a giant, who stands twelve cubits high,
And with eyes of red in his hundred heads, he awaits the passerby.
And you must slay the redeyed giant, and swim the river of slime,
Where the mucous beasts await to feast on those who journey by.
And if you slay the giant and beasts, and swim the slimy sea,

Why, as long as the Tzutzu flower still blooms, hope still blooms for me.""
And with tears of joy in his sunblind eyes, he slips the guru a five,
And crawls back down the mountainside, pursuing the perfect high.

""Well, that is that,"" says Baba Fats, sitting back down on his stone,
Facing another thousand years of talking to God, alone.
""Yes, Lord, it's always the same...old men or brighteyed youth...

It's always easier to sell 'em some shit than it is to tell them the truth.""

Shel Silverstein
You appear in red.
While i'm working.
You quiz my head.

It's not like falling in love
With rushes and curling waves
Of undefinable emotion,
And there is no cold sting of emptiness,
The first time water touches the skin.
It's not the entire blazing
Sky, orange as it goes
To night. It's not the orange fire
In your eyes.
Like the sea it's real,
Tangible in my mind.
It has sharp rocks that are
Good reason for you to cry.
It is slow like the tide.
It is you.


It turns the scattered dust in the atmosphere into magnifying glasses

Aimed directly at her

Spotlighting everything you wish you could put into words but can't

Because she's just too fucking unbelievable


The love she makes you feel in reality.

You would do everything for her.

Hold her until your bones start to crack

So that she'll understand just what you mean

When you tell her that you'll never let her go.

But she still doesn't get it.

She'll never understand that when you tell her that you want nothing more

Than to let your dust be her dust, her words to be in your cheeks

Her nose to be your daughters nose

You mean that you want nothing more than to keep her forever.

But you never will.

Because you never stood a chance.


That's not how this world works.

It never was.



For not taking her feelings into account.

Because she doesn't know what true love is.

She never felt the need to have you near.

For her daughters smile to be your smile.

For your hands to cradle her head when she's sad.


Because she's lost in the sound of your voice.


Scotch.
Smooth comfort shocks body.
Top notch.
Shots: two O’Clock on dot
to drown sorrows.

Scotch.
Strong control on poor body.
Top notch.
Stop: lost fool who opts for wrong
too short of tomorrow.
and the period is tired of putting a stop to things.
It wants to take the sentence beyond
the white space of the page
to where the hyphen can finally standup,
and the equal sign is free to celebrate life’s differences.
The question mark is willing
to offer some answers for once,
and conjunctions are ready to commit
to a single phrase or clause now,
but habits are harder to break than rules.
Truth is, the poem is trying to quit
the topics of love and death
and is avoiding the flower altogether,
because it reminds him of both.
The novel, well, it’s giving up the plot
and letting events occur as random as dreams,
which happens to be
in the midst of a messy divorce with chaos,
because he’s been flirting with order for a while now.
And now, the present,
this whole time he’s been running away with the past,
and they’ve been trying to scream
something back at us in the future,
but the exclamation point
has become so shy and quiet.


I savor every taste they share,
Fleeting bits of flame;
The timid seconds of frivolous joy
appearing in soft bodies
on the impetuous forward grind.
Whispering sentiments so heavy
they dictate human to my curious mind.
All his days laid down by hand,
in hopes these bits of encounters stand
up to the current of loneliness,
Cleansing blue rapids
that wash the world away.
Unraveling youth and truth, and you,
whose flesh I savor ravenously,
Mind I’d sooner try caress
with deeper raptures in my chest,
If hearts bled painlessly.

To be, I savor every hue;
Wavelengths that coat the elderly skies blue
with certainty, I never learned to love,
Colors merge too far above
to accept what darkness often sees
Landscapes, green,
Include oceans of trees gladly,
and you uphold the innate sight.
You, whose colors shift along the hours,
Find delight where my strange sentiment scours.
I savor the glimpse and cannot obey.
I see no other way.


pussy Aurelius and catamite Furius,

you who think, because my poems

are sensitive, that I have no shame.

For it's proper for a devoted poet to be moral

himself, [but] in no way is it necessary for his poems.

In point of fact, these have wit and charm

if they are sensitive and a little shameless,

and can arouse an itch,

and I don't mean in boys, but in those hairy old men

who can't get it up

Because you've read my countless kisses,

you think less of me as a man?

I will sodomize you and facefuck you

.

There's plenty of that
going around
between political campaigns
and smiling at work.
So when you want to write a poem,
but have no pretty words:
why not jerk off
instead?
Some days

it feels like

my heart's attached to a polygraph

and it skips

everytime I say it.


Some days

it feels like

you're screaming into a cave

and waiting

for an echo.



I think about you

in the bathtub, eating

strawberries:

a thin veil

of pink monochrome.


I think about me

leaning down, whispering

in your ear:

wondering if it counts as lying

when I don't know


In the shortest

Most transparent

Most honest way

How it is with you

How your body acts

How I presume you are thinking

In the wordless rapport

Of the early movements

After dinner and drinks

And clumsy banter

With my hands in yours

And your words on my neck

And the sighing movement

Like a tree branch

No longer buoyed by wind

Making its small, exhausted

Move, collapsing to the bed,

It would be: Oh well.

Oh well, he is taking me here,

He is doing this to me again.

The way a child puts her head

On the car seat with her mother driving

When her mind begins to wander.

Oh well, I will let my body go.

I want to go to Paris
believing they would think me
some sort of intellectual

Now they ask me what I want to be,
I tell them, ""nothing;
when my eyes are sore from crying,
when my throat is raw from asking why.

I cannot sing for her,
when my heart is torn in two,
when my smiles are completely fake.

I cannot sing for her,
when I can't think of a song to sing,
when my voice is stuck in my throat.

But I will sing for her, when I know she'd want to hear me,
when my eyes are dry,
when my heart is healed,
when my smile is real,
when my mind is sharp,
when my voice is clear and strong.

But all is well in hell
My body unravels, edges fray
A ghost trapped in a shell

I'd be your conquistador
If you would be my Spanish whore
Gripping beads of rosary
Waiting, watching from the shore

The stars still scream your name
As I try to find North true
I search the sky to navigate
But all I see is you

Strange indeed, this painful need
To catch the wind again
Islands pass and dark clouds breed
As winter storms close in

All is well in hell today
Flames dance around my feet
There’s a special place reserved for you
And soon, my friend, we’ll meet

Never drop anchor,
Never turn ship
This was the poets law without falter

But pressed against your lips,
Disposition slips
And now I am bent before your altar

I died a little more today
But not a single breath was waste
All is well in hell you see
Because the stars still show your face

Scattered 'cross space, through the temporal mist,

It can be said that there must be a few,

Where you are with me and I am with you,

So although things today might seem pretty tough,



Prettiest glitter ever made
So intricate
As if crafted by little hands.
Like lace made of glass.


Falling by.
Who choreographed such a lovely dance?
Jack Frost? Father Winter?
Or maybe the angels up above?
He keenly winked at me,
His distant suit of dust alight
With morbid gravity.

He smiled, as a martyr does,
Aware of his demise.
His tail of needled brilliance was
Emblazoned in the skies.

He dutifully crossed my path;
I saw him disappear.
Oh, what a shame he met the wrath

Points out the same amber

Stain on his shorts that I've got on mine, and

Makes me smell his smell, coming

From me; he switches channels, recites an old poem

He wrote before his mother died,

Stands, shouts, and asks

For a hug, as I shrink, my

Arms barely reaching around

His thick, oily neck, and broad back; 'cause

I see my face, framed within

Pop's blackframed glasses

But you should not waste your breath, for
It is not your fault.
I'm sure you want to say
You'd stay if you could.
I'm sure we both know
That despite how hard it is
How much you want to remind me
That you love me; I know
That it's true,
But it doesn't matter
You had to move on
Whether I was ready or not
You couldn't wait anymore
And I know that's fair.
You went on with your life
And who am I to blame you
As you said your final goodbye,
I said my first hello.

and ran down evening streets.

And we awoke the sleeping town

so denizens would see.




But now you’re gone, they sleep again

and now I’m sleeping, too.

Willows weep along the streets


Fire
By Son of Gocsick, Age 4.

The ﬁre of our house burnt down sometime ago.
But I just love ﬁre,
because I want to be a ﬁreman.

Just ﬁre,
I just love them.
Fire, just ﬁre
I’m so like, we can just hug them.
If they come to life.

Yes
So just Fires,
You just play the piano.
If you be.
If you come to life forever.
Fires, I just love you.

Fires, if you come to life for a long time
(but not forever)
I will sing to you.

Dear ﬁre,
I like to write you a note,
But please don’t burn it down.

Dear ﬁre,
Just, I love you.
Just ﬁre,
Just ﬁre,
Just ﬁre,
I don’t love anything but ﬁre.

edit fixed some typos




at your apartment, I find your first boyfriend

in your cracked ash tray,


the boy who called you a slut

in the black turtlenecks you wear,

the boy who said you were impossible to love

in the depth of your embrace.


You told me that they're long gone

and that you're here with me

now, but I can still hear them

like muffled gunshots

from around the block.


I want to dip you

in ice water, bury you in sand,

throw you over my shoulder

like spilled salt. I want

to give you a new name.


I want you to be mine,

just mine, for one night.

Lock ourselves in your bedroom

and let the candles burn down

to the wick.


But you bleed forgiveness

and it spreads across the bedsheets

like the red harvest moon

over wet pavement

at 10 o'clock.


I think of airplanes,

and that they can only hold

up to 578 souls, like burning candles

in a midnight vigil,

and that people should have

a maximum capacity too.


You are the entire world

in one breath,

and I am choking.
my hair much curlier,
I would ride my bigwheel around the block and
spash my plastic wheels through the
great dirty rain puddle
and I would giggle.

Presidents changed,
then changed again,
but the puddle still sits. Same
puddle. New water, same
lack of a drain. New dead leaves floating  fallen from the same
trees. New gnats
unaware of the way
I swallowed two of their ancestors.

And me
still me, but much bigger, and
I have a beard.
Now when I splash through
I drive a Camry
who pays any attention
to the syntax of things
will never wholly kiss you;
wholly to be a fool
while Spring is in the world

my blood approves,
and kisses are a better fate
than wisdom
lady i swear by all flowers. Don't cry
the best gesture of my brain is less than
your eyelids' flutter which says

we are for each other: then
laugh, leaning back in my arms
for life's not a paragraph

And Death i think is no parenthesis

catch yourself
thinking of me
it is most likely
I am somewhere, on a city bus
brushing the sleep off my eyes,
and dreaming of you
and your fool's gold hair
and your tiny bones
and your alabaster skin,
I spoke answers without hearing questions,
I parked by expired meters,
and I danced with the girl I loved in an empty parking lot, snow
starting to fall, with no music to guide our steps.



Twentytwo took my answers and left only empty space.
I wondered what my friends really thought of me,
I paid my parking tickets on time,
and I regretted the kiss I shared with my love
when she asked to hide it from her boyfriend.



At twentythree I started asking the right questions.
Like, how can I improve life for others,
what is responsibility,
and, do you still have a boyfriend?



At twentyfour, I fell in love with myself at twentyone.
I forgot what others were thinking,
I started riding the subway,
and I stopped wishing that parking lot

If
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
And stoop and build ’em up with wornout tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
And risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!

everyone tells me it's good for my health.

I'll take it in the morning to start off my day.

then I walk out into life, and the pain stays away.

I can sing I can laugh I can talk with my friends,

I could write a nice poem from beginning to end.

oh the things i can do with that pill on the shelf;




At twenty, I loved

Bukowski. I get him now



Or it's a perfectly good end to an already pretty decent day.

""Could be worse"", do you remember that saying? Yes it could and it will

""Could get better"", do you remember that saying? Yes it could and it will

Shedding her clothing like scales about the room.
She has seven sketchbooks not half filled
With faces. Some reappear while others wait
Alone, unfinished.

A desk stacked with unread stories, empty pens,
And full bottles of perfume,
Sits against a worn bed with rustled sheets

He’s got questions.
A whole knapsack full of them.
And it weighs down upon his back,
Cracking, bending, breaking,
The little, brittle bones of his spine.
He’s like Atlas.
Like the Greek Titan of whom he’s read in books,
not like the books of maps which he reads,
Which leads us to his first question;
Why does he like books so much?

Well, books speak to him when others refuse to,
Though it may be because he refuses to look them in the eye,
Because his nose is always buried in a book,
But that’s the chicken and the egg.
That’s just another question.

Another burden.
It’s funny.
People use the word “cross” to mean burden. “That’s my cross to bear.”
And yet, their crosses of sliver and gold that they wear around their neck,
They seem so light.
He has long since been abandoned by his imaginary friends.
Though he still wanders in the same twisted fantasy land,
He is alone, and that is his burden.

Another question:
Is being alone a burden, or a blessing?
He seems to think the latter,
Weekend night after weekend night, hunched over on the Berber rug,
Suckling ash from glass, breathing fire into the air purifier,
Seeking to melt his mind melt into juvenility.

He says he’s not one for numbers, but by his count,
There are one hundred billion neurons in his brain,
And he has an IQ of one hundred and seventy five,
So if he grinds up snorts a thousand milligrams of Sudafed,
And slits his wrists seventeen times, and cries,
Until he loses seventyfive cc’s of blood,
And his veins are dried,
Then by the time that he wakes up in the hospital,
He should still be able to read at a thirdgrade level.

Though all it did was leave him with more questions.
my arms were braced
he used my face
and everything was
NO

pushing me against the wall
he was asking
as he was entering
and all I said was
NO

I needed something to control
rewinding scenes
reliving things
to cleanse myself of
NO

now I crawl across the floor
a different time,
a different life
and everything is
YES

shaking with adrenaline
he knows my name
and gives me pain
and all I say is
YES

making heaven from a hell
I lose control
and find my soul
and everything is
YES

bathing in adrenaline
he knows my name
and gives me pain
I cleanse myself with
YES

your bones heavy.
You know more
with each breath, more
than I could
in a dozen lifetimes.

You speak more languages
than I could name, staccato syllables
like barefeet hitting pavement;
words you write on the mirror
without lifting a finger.


Everyday you burn,
brighter than I ever could and
all I can do is watch,
but I don't mind. If there is anything
that I have learned from love,
it is you.

But:

When we lay underneath
the tightly knit sky, the
night wrapped around
us like a shroud,
I unravel against you.

You lean away,
further into the ground, down
into the earth like it was
only ever yours.

(Like you
were never mine.)

There is something
caught in my throat,
a bitter taste
on my tongue.

I can only think of how
you know thousands
of words for love
and yet cannot come up
with even
one
of
over and over.
You would ask me what it meant.
I don't know.

You would stencil it out
in every color.
You would offer me your best guess but
I don't know.

You would draw my face
next to yours.
You would ask if it's true.

And now
miles and memories apart,



I found my old backpack in the attic the other day,

I thought I had thrown it away and this backpack gave me a flashback.

It used to be a backpack filled with dreams,


Now you probably want to know what was in my old backpack

so lean back as I backtrack and give you a recap of my flashback.

Let me start from the beginning.

It was the first day of first grade,

I was sitting on my bench as my thoughts strayed.

I promise I was barely there, some kids had their heads in the clouds,

I had mine in the atmosphere.

Of course I couldn't focus on what the teacher said

when the new Little Pirate kit lied waiting impatiently in my backpack.

This kit contained a spyglass, a compass and a cutlass,

just wanted to grab my backpack and cut class.

But as I sat in the bench the backpack was just out of my reach,

so close yet so far away,


dreaming about sitting in the dock of the bay.

In my dreams I would be a pirate,

sailing the seven seas with a jolly roger flag waving in the breeze,

bombarding enemy ships into debris

I had a short attention span,

barely noticed that my teacher read aloud from Peter Pan.

I suddenly felt her eyes on me like laserbeams penetrating my dreams.

She asked me if I had a problem with the book and I shook my head.

I just wanted to be the crook in every book I read.

I just wanted to be Captain Hook and he wanted Peter to drop dead

Everyone, including my teacher, laughed.

I don't even remember her name, or why she laughed at me.

I called her Mrs. Shedevil and I wanted to watch her drown below sea level.

I don't even know what she needed me to be,

but when I'm older I'll be a pirate and I'll feed her to the sea.

I guess what I want to say is,

my teacher embodied the reality that was forced upon me and my classmates.


they will never receive a letter from Hogwarts,

Santa isn't real, and their parents will die one day.

Now snap back from the backtrack and I've grown,

underneath a tombstone.

I found my old backpack in the attic the other day,

for now it is there it will stay,

I'm going to keep it until the day I have a child but then I'll give it away.

I promise I will put a snowcannon in my child's closet,

write fake letters from Hogwarts,

dress as Santa every Christmas and tell my child I'm immortal.

Of course that would be a lie,

and just like my dreams of being a pirate,

one day I will die.


but for the sake of our children sometimes we will have to pretend.


Sometimes the street’s gray concrete

starts to creep up over the grass

rolling over the lawn all the way up

to my front door, killing the green

and claiming the space as its own.

I see it moving and I flee the city,

taking air in big, panicked gulps

until the rot rolling through

my car windows is replaced

by grass and rainwet air.

The pavement at my back

urges me into the country,

onto dirt roads and our house

above the lake, where I

can stand on the balcony

and lean into cool wind.



٭



I hear her voice at times like these.

“Go.” She tells me. “You’re always better

after you get out of the city for a while.

That’s the reason your grandfather

bought a ranch, right? That’s why he built

a house on it. He knows you need an escape

from your life here every once in a while.

Things are easier out there, slower, cleaner.

I promise, you’ll come back

feeling whole.”



٭



The area just northeast of the house is host

to an annual meeting of two large weather fronts

which converge in the early months of summer,

and result in a chain of storms that can last months.

The house’s back wall is covered with storm

windows, large enough to admit a view

of the horizon in panorama, and thick enough

to endure facing directly into the hard, constant

wind out the northeast. In the early summer,

you can watch the wind heave thunderheads

straight at you. They eat up the horizon, shadows

racing across the lake and up the back porch.



At night, the lightning burns

your stormdark vision

with such remorseless detail

that the images linger

briefly in negative

before fading away,


like a toovivid memory

that screams to be remembered,

but is ignored by eyes grown

accustomed to only grays

and dull edges.




٭



Out on the balcony, I sweat

beside my grandfather in the coming dusk.

We’ve spend the day in the pasture

uprooting mesquite trees

and stacking them into burn piles.

Grandfather says that once the fields

are clear we might plant some cotton.

Then you’ll find out what real work is,

he tells me. Just last week

I saved a man who hung himself

down in the Huntsville state prison.

Hangings will usually void their bowels,

but when we cut off his pants

there was nothing but a little blood,

so we checked him for wounds

and found that he had recently

suffered severe rectal tearing.

The mass of fresh sutures around his anus

prevented any rectal prolapse

or involuntary bowel movement.

I stand with my grandfather,

watching the sky change

and say nothing.

In the fields behind us

piles of dead mesquite

quietly wait to be burned.



٭



I used to watch the stars out there.

They were clearest in winter,

when it would get so cold

that the air molecules

would just stand still

and let the starlight

pass right through them,

unbent by motion

or the glare of a city,

landing like snowflakes

on upturned eyes.

It was like that for years,

until oil was discovered

in the shale deposit

that ran through the county.

In months giant, still derricks

lined the horizon

like a dozen skylines

in miniature

sprung up so suddenly

that the surrounding air

was startled into motion,

waving, pulsing with the heat

of the gas flares

lighting up the night

alongside the derricks


by hurrying fuel

from the deep

and setting it

immediately to burn

atop tall thin towers.

The flames were bright

and constant and slipped

like a blanket between

me and the stars.

In the darkness after

the only light comes

from their sick yellow glow.



٭



Thunder wakes me from a dream

of King Lear in the squall.

Rain and wind pound storm windows

and I’m starting to remember

where I am when my grandfather

bursts in the room wet and naked

shouting that the fields are ready

to be planted and it’s time I found out

how real men earn a living.

I’m up and words of protest

begin to form in my mouth

but are caught somewhere

in the larynx as I look down

at my own nakedness

to find my body hairless

and prepubescent, exposed

testicles humiliatingly undescended.

A bolt of lightning fills

my vision with a sea of white

and the storm window

behind my grandfather erupts

in a shower of glass shards.

I blink away the light

before seeing him on the floor,

still yelling—his admonitions

becoming frantic, deranged,

as he tells me that citylife

has reduced me to nothing but

a poor, bare, forked animal,

and begins to weep as he asks

why I won’t let him teach me

to be a man like he did my father

and looking at me his mouth

twists in that vicious brand of disgust

the old and hard reserve

for weakness nurtured by privilege.

The question escapes like a deathrattle:

is man no more than this?

Toowet eyes stare red and unblinking,

as I pull on my uniform and open

the trauma bag to get an IV started,

but when I do he rips out the needle,

and when I try to stop the bleeding

he pulls away the gauze

and claws at his lacerations

until shock and blood loss

drag him into unconsciousness.

When I begin mouth to mouth

my teeth crumble and fall

into his airway, suffocating him.



٭



I say it again to be sure: It’s not real.



٭



From the balcony I watch the lake

slowly grow darker as red algae spreads

through it like rust. It will kill every

living thing in the lake before it too dies.



٭



the smell of the diesel won’t come out

of my fucking clothes it follows

me like a deathwatch clinging

to my hair and my skin

I kneel behind the ambulance where

the tailpipe sends off heat in waves

and almost instantly grafts the soft

tissue of my lips onto the sootblack metal

when I wrap my mouth around it

and inhale lungfulls of exhaust

with desperate heaving gasps

that wrack my chest like spasms

and burst the vessels in my eyes

until the white of the sclera

is replaced with a red hemorrhage

that spreads across my face like rust

and turns tears pink with blood

until black finally starts to creep

around the edges of my vision

and all I can see are twin streams

of smoke rising out of my nostrils



٭



My grandfather takes me to the middle

of our property, where a long burn

has been cleared for the pipeline

that now runs beneath where we stand.

This is where we’ll plant it. He says.

You’re too young to know it,

but things are about to get real bad.

We’re going to have to be able

to take care of ourselves. He

laughs. You might just have

to do a little bit of real work.

The ground is muddy,

and has been cleared for twenty

yards on either side of us, ending

where the mesquite forms a wall

that stretches along the burn’s edge

for its entire length.

I notice that the mud

Has bubbled up in places,

forming pools that give off

the dark, unnatural sheen

of chemical infiltration.

I imagine pushing my fingers

into the earth to make

way for seed. Black

oil rushes in to fill the hole,

eager to poison, eager to blight.

I listen to my grandfather

knowing that whatever we plant

here will grow only briefly

if at all, and will never

be enough to sustain us.

I agree that some horrible

change is coming,

but it will be slower

and more real

than my grandfather

believes. I’ve seen it

with a closeness

he isn’t strong enough for.

I know it in a way he will refuse

to until it has him,

because of the way it reeks

of shit and piss,

and because it is humiliating

and difficult and lets you know

in no uncertain terms

that you must face it alone.

It is boring, and in the end

unemotional, except for relief

and guilt over that relief.

It is selfish, it moves

quickly forward and is soon

unashamed of it,

because pain is only truly

real when it is your pain,

and nothingness cannot

be truly real for anyone,

and because it is so easy

to dwell on other things.

Old fields lay fallow,

the crops of the past

are consumed and forgotten.

The ground is poison,

it kills all its children.



٭


I say it again




٭



I can smell summer coming

in the wind, cooled

over the lake and sweetened

by the cattail, the little bluestem

reeds circling the water.

It catches dovecalls,

the low cicadahum,

and I know the heat

is not far off now,


that our brief respite

is drawing to a close,

that I am once again

tilting to face the sun.

I spin toward summer

growing restless, growing mad.

Even the wind knows it.



٭



I say it again



٭



24 hours without sleep

and the lights are burning

out my night vision

I can feel them like needles

behind my eyes

I smash the headlights

and walk over the shards

in my bare feet



٭



I’m in the back

of the ambulance

with a patient while we

transport him to the hospital

but he is screaming

he won’t stop and my god

he’s been at it the whole ride

I make sure the straps

fastening him to the stretcher

are secure

then open the back doors

and roll him out

onto the blaring

freeway where he is hit

by the oncoming traffic



٭



I deliver a baby

on the floor of a project apartment

surrounded by the stinking

refuse of its tenants

I stare at empty mcdonalds

bags and cups and napkins

as I push both thumbs

through the soft spot

of the infant’s head



٭



I return to the city just ahead of the rain.

The smell of it is heavy in the air, inescapable.



I return to the city always

trapped in the dark

liminality



between opposing fronts,

static and useless

and beginning to stagnate;

reduced



to a desperate collection

of hair and skin,

knocked about

by the wind

as all the flailing,

token resistance

is slowly and perfectly

robbed of force

and of meaning

until there is only

resignation—



a lifting of closed eyes

some final moments

spent as a living

ground for the storm’s

unthinking energy.

edit: formatting
I'm only a cast away,
but this is not the story of the sea
into which we dive
only to find the sky looking back at us.
Nor is this the story of the window, where,
outside
the dreams die behind the hour long fences
that stretch up and touch the clouds.
No,
some birds were made to sing
but I think I'm the bird
So that they may reflect the man we know
To reach the stairs beyond the heavens, bound,
godspeed! brave one, leave these lands you sew

You walk the gilded steps unto The Throne
With gates of gold, be still, your joyous heart,
for There you'll rest, at best; chance is unknown,
when your kin will cease to live apart.

But as the sands of time begin to fall,
The black recedes in days of long ago.
Yet! In the weary minds, of one, of all,
sleeps the tears of ours that came to show.

The life you lived, while short, will be held high.
naught but your vassal left, we say goodbye.
With chestnut hair and alabaster skin:
The timbre of your voice and the confidence in your smile;
The color of your lips and the subtlety to your style,
Left this humble barkeep bewildered and awestruck.
Yet I did not let these feelings show,
For fear of the fate or providence or luck,
""I think I may be in love with you, but I love quickly and often.
I am worried it is only my desire for sex, and that I promise
Only for the pleasure of promising, and that
I think of not only you but also every woman I have ever loved,
And that my obsession for you comes from my obsession for fucking,
And my obsession, equally strong, for finding a second mother.""

And few women, holding a man in bed, would confess:
""I think I may be in love with you, but I know love is often confused
With the giddiness of possessing something. What you mean for my life,
What you might provide me, can in my imagination be so intoxicating,
I lose any notion of who you are! For even now, holding you,
With your warm body and the pleasure of your promises,
frying herself in bacon fat, residual,
doesn’t even eat bacon, asexual,
fidgeting with something she found, ineffectual,
festering in her frigid room, eventual,
never getting the feather duster out
to brush away the rigid gloom,
indispensable.

Her heart takes orders from other people’s neurons, deceiving
pumping liquid love into a face she doesn’t believe in,
all valves open and bleeding all over her sleeve and
those who don’t know her are
missing something new and blue
and they could fuel her with cannabis,
ethanol, and caffeine, it’s true, but you,
you can fuel her with your love,
she’ll sprint a thousand springs,
laugh a thousand times on wings,
make a thousand pretty things.

These days she lurks in LED boxes
trying to find out new things about oxytocin
as if biology is the sole reason for her sadness.

These things make her cry so much she might as well be
one big puffy red eyeball, rolling, forlornly ‘just fine’
as sweet as jam and as aimless as jelly

With my elephant skin

I never forgive and I never forget

And I thought of suicide

But you aren't worth my time

Let alone my life

I hope you fuckers taste me until the day you die

I hope that you can taste my spit

When you're standing lip in lip

And when you're grinding against his hips

Fuck, I just want this to end

Drink up the night sky
So sweet, unquenchable
Neon lights blur and swirl
Around the edges of my vision

Insidiously lit by a summer moon
The night hisses and hums
Like my mind is stuck between
The stations of a radio

The sky is the way I’ve always
Pictured you, soft and flowing
Here and gone too soon
A beautiful mystery

And I sit and ponder
Elbows on the counter
I’m like these glasses
Lined up on the bar

Drunk

I am proud of who I am

from the family I have

to my tribe

and to my race.


I am proud of who I'll be

from my religion

to my songs,

and the friends I make along

I am proud of who I am.

From my body to my soul

and the life I'm going to live

I am proud of me

and that's ok
I don't know when it is
and that's ok, I don't want to.

But just to be fun,
I'll pick a random day
perhaps a sunny summer one
and pretend that's the day.

And I'll send your way all the rays
of the sun, and I'll bless the trees
to blossom, and paint all the flowers white
I'll conduct the belling birds
and wrestle the rain should he
dare make a sight

I'll grow in greatness an endless sea of green grass
and burn a fire path to lead your dress
to the heart of the hearth
I'll smoke up my very first cigar
and raise to you all the champagne on this Earth

And on this day I will
swallow my heart,
silence my mind,
tear out my eyes,
and throw my arms to the skies
And with all my muster and might
I will roar a raging cry
and proclaim until the day I die

nothing. Because it's not my place
at your side.
And that's ok.
Congratulations.

Quite a predicament for me

With nothing good to say

I cannot teach the world a thing

But selfishly I'll stay

pansy, faggot, ad hominem attractor,
wannabe, pretentious, asinine, facetious,
jerkoff artist with his butt where his mouth is—
and there you sit, eyes glued to a screen
hands tapping keys, intellect only keen
on putting me, a stranger, low
and yet you add nothing of note

and that is selfcondemnation enough:

and you don't answer at the door, I fumble

with the doormat until I find the spare key.

Your apartment

feels like a photograph, sodium glow

and floating dust.

And I know.


The bathroom is shut

and the lights are on

and it's quiet. Part of me

wants you to be alright,

shaving your legs

in the bathtub. Part of me

wants the waiting to stop,

to stop breathing the dust

of your painted life.


I think of when I first laid eyes on you,

three years ago,

sitting on a park bench

dressed in August heat. And how part of me

thought, don't look at me,

don't look at me

so I can still turn around.

And how the other part screamed:

look at me or I'll die.


(Don't they say the end

is only as good

as the beginning?)


When I open the door

and see you on the linoleum floors,

covered in red, tall thin legs

like organ pipes and eyes

like the deep end of the pool,

like the step you take

after you turn the lights off,

I fold myself over you

and remember two nights ago

when I combed your hair,

it smelled like strawberries

but darker

and just as sweet

and you cried

and I told you to stay

and you said,

where am I going?


(I remember you told me

that when you were young,

you used to let your balloons go

on purpose.)


When I look up at the ceiling

to see the last thing you saw,

speckled offwhite,

I hope that the part of you

that wanted to let go

wasn't the part that kissed my neck

in the middle of the night.


But I think

Before the puppet
Severs his strings
Falling down
Before the audience

My purpose would be simple

I’d know why I was soft inside

and had a hole in my heart

I’d see a glazed look on my neighbour’s face

and wouldn’t think of it as a depressing trend

I wouldn’t see or think

not know how to hear

the troubles in the world

Being a donut

I wouldn’t last long, though

It might even get boring

Complexity and simplicity are both

relative in perspective

Drama can be a lesson

But a donut

And told you that
I think
There are some parts of a person
That should be kept,
And not be thrown away.

Your family didn’t understand
That I refused
To simply be bent and worn
Like the ring on this ‘ring finger’
Of my left hand.

But the truth is I’m already worn
By so many people I no longer know
Like a hoody left behind after a onenightstand.

As hard as I’ve tried
To keep myself contained
In each escape
I’ve spilled over
And given parts of me away.
And I resent
That someone somewhere
Has my virginity screwed up
In a pile of dirty washing on his floor.
And someone somewhere
Has my favourite place by the river
Pushed back amongst the rubbish in his chest of drawers.
And someone somewhere
Wears my favourite song so smugly
Every time
I see his fucking face contort
That fucking grin that says
“I know you”
In a way
I can’t displace.

So when you tried to take my name
I told you no
As it would only be
Another part of me I can’t reclaim.

I’ve learned to hold on tight
To who I am
Because so much of her
Is in places I can’t reach
A nightmare really
The worst kind, truly.
I dreamt of when I'd met you
And how I loved you
And what was worst?

there is a match
burning on the table
in the house
we're locked out of

your hands are cupped
against the dustencrusted window
you're watching it
closely

the house
is on the branches of a tree
the tree is on the summit of a mountain
the mountain is its own island

I'm standing on the ocean floor
my arms vertically out towards you
waiting
for decades

you are a butterfly
I am a starfish
we've never met
let's put the top down and drive to a place where
we've never been before and lay

in grass and leaves that arent yet
dead, they still have colors
red, and yellow, and orange, and brown,
for the autumn won't count its dead before
the winter darkness beckons them.

until then, i have an idea
let's grow our hair and shout our secrets from
the bottom of thicktrunked trees

whose bark is cold to the touch when
we climb into its carousel of
twisting arms and forgotten fingers that
we give names to and make remembered as the
western wind bends them in its shivery chill.

i have an idea
let's drink steamy coffee and tangle limbs when
no one sees us watching the gravel

that covers the ground in a seeded
chalk bed where travellers stop and
take a breath and wrap their hands
and brush their cheeks and cover up when
no one cares to build a fire.

hey, i have an idea
let's gather jackets and vests and scarves
and pack our bags for a trip where

we don't know where we're going until
the train stops screeching in the central
station of some great city with softwhite windows,
and bearded men with newspaper sleeves,
and taxis honking in the palelined streets.

i have an idea
let's learn to dance before december arrives
of a hundredstory fall,
I became absurdly certain:
Nothing was certainly
about to change
But do not ask me how, for I shant tell
And who was in my way? By God, ‘twas you!
Souls I would trade, and kisses I would sell.
You stared at me, ‘twas held for a long time.
Your pants had holes, and how the skin did show!
The wind, that eve, had no reason or rhyme.
And now I wonder where it is you go?
I met you recently, and ‘tis insane
My number I would give to you with smiles
‘Tis hard to look at you. Perhaps my brain
Is wondering why you are running miles.
The boys all chase me; they want me to wife.
I missed you ‘ere you came into my life.
So many times it could of happened.
As I gaze into the past.



And the Angels sing my name.
Calling calling calling.
I hide beneath benefit and name.
Veteran I am but never the same.



Now I must read the headlines.
The War a Scam. No one to blame.
Returned to a country in ruin and shame.



I know I could be bright.
I know that I could dazzle,
Were I held up to the light.

I could be clear if polished;
I could be sharp if cut.
I could scratch this looking glass,
Were I not cozy in my rut.

For I fear the bloodied hands;
I fear the fake display.
And I fear the gilded clasp,
I'd rather be set in my way.

So in the dark, in the dirt,

partially humourous

that people subconsciously

find things like

car crashes

to be

romantic.

And, I mean

who can

blame them?

I sure as hell can’t

think of anything more

romantic

than twisted metal and

severed heads.

.

And I find it at least

partially humourous

that the concept of something like

marriage

does little more than

depress me.

And, I mean

can you

blame me?

‘Cause I sure as hell can’t

think of anything less

romantic

than a contract and

a fifty percent divorce rate.

.

But it’s getting hard to find

anything humourous

about the fact

that I can’t think of anything less romantic than

the concept of romance

itself

and

that I can’t think of anything more depressing than

the concept of happiness

itself

and

that since I lost my best friend I spend most nights on the verge of

vomit

and


the same

and

oh god

I don’t even know

who I am

The first cigarette of the day
When I’m walking to the subway
Sun in my eyes
A jolt of life
A reason to wake up

You are like
The first gulp of beer at the end of the week
When I’m tired and beaten
Glass on my lips
A sigh of relief
A reason to rest

You are like
The first paycheck of the month
When I don’t have to pay rent
Card in my hand
A cry of youth
A reason to dance

You are like
The first snowflake of the year
When all else is dead
Glitter in the streetlights
A delicate wonder
our lips raw with love
and how you gave me
everything you had
and how I
offered you what was left of
me,
and I will remember your small room
the feel of you
the light in the window
your records
your books
our morning coffee
our noons our nights
our bodies spilled together
sleeping
the tiny flowing currents
immediate and forever
your leg my leg
your arm my arm
your smile and the warmth
of you
who made me laugh
again.”
one thing.

You know how this is:
if I look
at the crystal moon, at the red branch
of the slow autumn at my window,
if I touch
near the fire
the impalpable ash
or the wrinkled body of the log,
everything carries me to you,
as if everything that exists,
aromas, light, metals,
were little boats
that sail
toward those isles of yours that wait for me.

Well, now,
if little by little you stop loving me
I shall stop loving you little by little.

If suddenly
you forget me
do not look for me,
for I shall already have forgotten you.

If you think it long and mad,
the wind of banners
that passes through my life,
and you decide
to leave me at the shore
of the heart where I have roots,
remember
that on that day,
at that hour,
I shall lift my arms
and my roots will set off
to seek another land.

But
if each day,
each hour,
you feel that you are destined for me
with implacable sweetness,
if each day a flower
climbs up to your lips to seek me,
ah my love, ah my own,
in me all that fire is repeated,
in me nothing is extinguished or forgotten,
my love feeds on your love, beloved,
and as long as you live it will be in your arms

make sure that they’re nervous

make sure that it locks

teach them all they're ugly

and make sure they're aware

that they will teach the others how to share in their despair.

Now take all the ugly people and place them in a box,

let them know they’re special

let them know they rock

teach them all they’re pretty

and let them know to share

their beauty with the others who still feel that they are bare.

Then put both groups together and let them have a chat,

see who won the battle,

see who got to laugh

let the loser slowly change

and see if they can knock,

those feelings that you taught them, inside that simple box.

It is by my favourite poet
Eamonn Marra

I want to do Heroin
Heroin is the sexiest drug
Something about needle insertion is sexy
William Burroughs did heroin
William Burroughs killed his wife
William Burroughs was a faggot

At my high school
Boys would cut the arms off their jerseys
To turn them into vests
If i cut my arms off
I would be an amputee

Sometimes I feel like both a veterinarian and an animal
And I need to operate on myself
And I need to be anesthetised
That’s why you should give me drugs

I don’t believe in mental illness
I just believe that some people are better than others

I can shoplift omega 3 from the supermarket
I don’t know where to shoplift a happy attitude

I think stalking is romantic
Please someone stalk me
I don’t go outside anymore
So it will be really easy for you

The thing about poetry is
Almost all the people who read poetry
Also write poetry
And they’re far more interested in others reading their poetry
Than they are in reading others
And realized I had not dreamt of you.
So many nights of longing that had gone unmet
After years of promises that were never kept
So many nights you had only come to me in a dream,
After hours of an open bottle
And two empty glasses
And long nights waiting,
Yearning
For something that was surely meant to be;
And yet..
In the morning's light I realized I had not dreamt of you
And my heart sank,
all the atoms of my body gathered together,
humming inside the fist of God;
waiting to escape
and spread
like diamonds across glass
over the face of the universe.
I think that when we die,
it's like the unveiling of stars at night



















&gt;Diving into Shards of glass

&gt;Every moment trudges past

&gt;In stuttered whispers hear me plea

&gt; ""Please, God, will you set me free?""

&gt;Heedless, hear the siren's song

&gt;Drawn towards that for which I long

&gt;Regardless of what comes to pass

&gt;Loathe what's in the lookingglass

&gt;Beckon on the coming storm

&gt;Simplicity in finest form

&gt;Destruction of what I have built

&gt;Grasp the blade to spite the hilt

&gt;Under stars comes rushing forth

&gt;A sense of ease, a pulsing warmth

&gt;To God I pray with my last breath


From when I was a boy

I loved it and I cared for it

It was better than a toy.

I cleaned it and polished it

And placed it on my shelf

I wouldn't let mum near it

I looked after it myself.

I wish i'd kept my woggle,

It was my pride and joy

I'd take it into school with me

When I was just a boy.

I really loved my woggle,

Just why I am not sure

I just wish I could remember

then walk outside and piss
off my balcony.
Before I do I look to my right
and see the lights of my neighbours’ house

I don’t think they

Like I do most nights,
Most days,
With strangers who smile
And walk away

And isn't it better
For an affair to be shortlived?

So much easier to grieve
And get over it
When the shape of her legs
Or the swish of a skirt
In the summer wind
Is all there is.

So much simpler
Than packing up boxes,
Erasing numbers from your phone,
Splitting up the books and the records,
Throwing out the old photos,

like a hospital gown,

and when your date says

you look beautiful, you laugh

like you're waiting for the punchline.


Loneliness is what your friends joke about:

ha ha, Saturday nightin watching Law &amp; Order

with my cat. You laugh along but don't dare

talk about the emptiness that settles like an anvil

in your stomach,

that every night you weave your stitches

only to break them,

that everyone treats your heart

like a fucking ash tray.


That you took up drama

so when you're Maria

crying over Tony's corpse,

you can pretend like the tears

aren't your own.


That your biology textbook

tells you people spend

onethird of their lives asleep

but it doesn't tell you what to do

if you never wake up.


That in art class, you have to start

your selfportrait over twice

and when your teacher asks what's wrong,

you tell her that there are 52 shades

of blue in this world,

and not a single one

is as deep

as yours.
a screamo metaphor for love or my shortsighted life
aspirations
This is




When its 3:00 A.M. and I've smoked entirely too much heroin
afraidawake that if I fall asleep
my dream will be long and peacefully
forever



so, I
think about this girl's naked frame
how I filled it
and was so low I could not cum



that in these hours I see death in a physical manifestation
in such great fear I wake the dog
hand him his mercenaries payment
and make him take second watch



when I close my eyes I
have this dream of my friend Tyler burning
down a gas station
to paint the aftermath, and he calls me a



""Sick Fuck!""
well,
I'm not the one burning down gas stations in others' dreams am I?
No one is sleeping now



Between death piloting its ship
the gas prices
means of travel sparse
female navels scarce



No one is sleeping now.








And she’s too busy tonight
Fucking everyone else
To bother to visit me
And tuck me in
Tighty
Warmly
So, instead I lay here
And curse
Her
And her very presence
For I know
As soon as she presses
Those dishonest lips
Against my skin
I’ll fall; timber
Only to curse the sun
When it lifts heavy lids
And forces me awake
Only to deny me
One more minute
God, they say, created man.

Conversely: dancing around the sod
Man, they say, created God

Watch your words or they may do
Something of the same to you.
That's easy to read
Where the writer has kept
Only what you need.


A laid back account,
Not always rhyming,
But with a good flow
And immaculate timing.


A short memoir
Of times that have passed,
Potent as a photo
And one day ago, you took the train
Back to your cousins house
Where you said you would be taken care of
And I said you could get all you needed right where you were
But, smiling, you looked up at me
Grasping my shoulder you whispered
It's not what I need


I couldn't understand the need for more
The need that surpassed this neighborhood
This collection of stories that we were writing
And then we went for a walk


The sweater you wore had a hole in it
But I didn't mention it because it seemed perfect
Like you put that hole there
Right there
And when you walked away
I regretted not mentioning it

I’m never going to be the man I want to be for you.

One time I spent the night at your place,

and in the morning before you woke up I made us breakfast, pancakes

on the griddle

Coffee on the pot, cannonball adderley low on the speakers.

When you woke up you just wished

That we could’ve gone out instead.

.

Another time I called you beautiful,

And I really meant it, you were beautiful.

But, I am ignorant, and you hadn’t finished putting your makeup on
yet.

You didn’t believe me, you thought I was just poking fun.

And when I swore my sincerity

You thought it was only because you call me your boyfriend.

.

We went to dinner in midtown,

and you said it was great.

You looked nice and it was just cold enough outside for

that sort of thing.

When I left you called my close friend

to tell her just how bad it was

and how much more I could’ve done.

.

I’ve been by your side in hospitals,

When your mother kicked you out

When you were too sick and too tired,

I wrote you A+ essays for your economics class (and I hate econ)

I waited up for you to get home from parties

Or from your 12 PM  12 AM shifts at work

I made peace with your family who hated me

I wrote you songs and sang them to you in Penn Station

I studied your favorite poets and read your favorite books

But,

I will never make you happy.

.

Because, again, I made a bad assumption.

I thought I knew what you were looking for.

.


I gave you love,


This poem
is a love poem.
You can tell
by its subtle
texture
and gentle use
of color.
It hints
at the sound of summer
and tickles your memories
with nostalgic smiles.
You might even
feel a slight
tugging sensation
at the corners
of your mouth,
a quickening of
your breath,
and a swelling
in your heart.
All of this
is perfectly natural.
After all,
This poem
that girl
with the
pretty smile and
no voice.

I want to be able to
bleed ink onto aging paper and
breathe poetry into lifeless lungs.
Stop people in their tracks as if
they didn't have a better place to be.

I'd like to
rattle numb minds with
tempting mistakes and
rash decisions.
Lead blind sheep
swandiving
off treacherous cliffs.

I need to
buckle
men and women
at the knees
with my words and
leave a ghostly path
in my wake.
Just a token
to remember when
my last whisper
escapes me.

Maybe one day.
If I ever get
my nose
out of the books,
keep my feet
on the ground, and
stop leaving my heart
Should I click Run or Cancel?
Not because my parents were bad, but perhaps
Out of boredom. I wanted to struggle, I think
More than I wanted to just exist, I wanted to live
And I wanted to nearly die. It would be so romantic,
To live on the streets, and to feel sorry for myself
In such a justifiable way, and no one would ever complain
That I was ungrateful. I'd dress in rags, and my face would be dirty
But I wouldn't care, that's not my priority. I would be brave,
And I would learn to survive, and I'd be tough but beautiful, too
And one day I would trade my heart, with a boy so equally true
And there's be no cost to our bargain, no taxes or payments due
This would all happen at least twohundred years ago, in London.
I imagined I would like to live then.


When I was a child, I wished I were an orphan
Not because my parents were bad, particularly but perhaps
Out of boredom. I wanted to struggle, more than
I wanted to just exist, I wanted to live
And I wanted to nearly die. It would be so romantic,
To live on the streets, and to feel sorry for myself
In such a justifiable way, and no one would ever complain
That I was ungrateful. I'd dress in rags, and my face would be dirty
But I wouldn't care, that wouldn't be a priority. I would be brave,
And I would learn to survive, and I would be tough but beautiful, too
And one day I would trade my heart, with a boy equally dark and true
And there'd be no cost to our bargain, no taxes nor payment due
This would all happen at least twohundred years ago, in London.
Talk as if the timing of your mouth is always right,
and let your words make meaning out of all
that has lead up to every moment that you are in.


Skip the dialogue that bloats your scripted actions
with the hollowness of rambling drama,
and cut to the real plays that you have always wanted to make.


Make the biggest scene that you can imagine,
and in the chaos
slip your heart in between two quotation marks
and make them eat those words,
so that they taste the true soul of the story
your story.


Speak in badass movie quotes.

I am warm darkness in the belly of the beast.
I swallow men whole.

I am envy, I love like a sea monster.
I am calm and terror, the rusted anchor
at the pit of a drowning man's stomach.
I am salt water, flooding his lungs.

I am ten years of tempest and unending rain,
I am an oil spill on black ocean.
I am windstorm; I smother, I take,
Today when I leaned against you I could hear your heart beating.
Circulation, warm blood, veins, the back of your hands,
Your skin almost translucent, the hair falling over your eyes.
I listen to your breath, hear the air fill your lungs.

That close to you, for a moment, very quiet.
I breathe in what you exhale: the same molecules,
constantly in motion, warmed in your chest, then in mine,
my heart)i am never without it(anywhere
i go you go,my dear; and whatever is done
by only me is your doing,my darling)
i fear
no fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want
no world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)
and it's you are whatever a moon has always meant
and whatever a sun will always sing is you

here is the deepest secret nobody knows
(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud
and the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows
higher than the soul can hope or mind can hide)
and this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart







While the sea is cool and black
For you see you must see sea things

seven months ago

that was sixteen minutes long.

The first twenty seconds

were you reminding me

to pick up some food

because all that was left in the fridge

were two rotten peaches. You had forgotten

to hang up then, and stuck the phone

in your coat pocket.


Fifteen and a half minutes

of you breathing.

I drank it in like cough syrup,

listening to it over and over and over again,

always stopping it

before it ended,

always stopping it

before you took the last breath.


I lined up your things on my bookshelf

the way a doctor keeps objects

from foreign body surgeries,

the way kids keep their baby teeth

in their sock drawer.

An old tube of lipstick,

a leather notebook,

a bottle of perfume,

wondering if I could fold them inside of me

like a Russian nesting doll.


I put them in my car one morning

and drove out to the lake

and threw them in, one by one.

I played the voicemail

to the end

and heard your heartbeat

stop

and watched the sky

turn to mist around me:

the view of the world

through an old lacetrimmed blouse.


I remember reading somewhere

that watching the fog rise in the morning

was just like watching

a human soul

evaporate.
just drinking plain black mug of coffee looking at pine trees
With plain light brown land as background
With sign of no cloud or snow in the sky
Also looking at the sunrise
from the east is the feeling of spring
But cup of coffee is just so tasty
with the feeling of no hope of doing school
to but it will be done anyway
I’m just listening to plane fly by over the building with happiness
and smile on my face because of plane sound like a pilot in the plane
Did you get that? Ion?
It's not like you're all that beautiful,
It's just all the good ones Argon.

But like Oxygen and Potassium, you're OK
And you'll find I can be quite caring.
I'd really like to bond with you
But not covalently. I don't like sharing.

I've dropped an electron, but I'm feeling positive,
I'm prepared for living large,
Maybe you're feeling a little negative
But at least on dates there'd be no charge.

I know that you're oh so Noble
So I've not much need for tact;
No matter what I say or do,
You probably won't react.

This happens periodically
And shows no signs of ceasing
My face is going exothermic,
My enthalpy increasing.

I find you so sublime
Though I hope you don't disappear
I know together we'd be golden
A! U! Get over here!

My soul is blemishfree
So I'm making no apology
I know that we've got chemistry
i hope that someone has already made coffee.


and i hope that it is burnt, murky, and black.


so i can flip the fuck out
and scream out at the top of my lungs:


""who burnt this fucking coffee?""


but no one ever makes coffee.


i guess i could scream out at the top of my lungs:


""why the fuck isn't there any coffee?""


but i'm not the type to make demands.
and i'm not the type to take a stand.


i'm the type of person that burns the coffee.
(not caring that it's the fifth time)
If only to see your body
Ringing
With that fever
of a laugh.
Like your body was a bell,
I would pull that rope
For that blessing of a smile
And not care for the damage

with beauty so fair,

books never get old as i sit in this chair.

focus unnatural,

future so bright,

why does my bladder not quite work right?

no matter this pester,

im perfectly fine,

Mood dips; bottle hits lips
Mind races; body paces
Lost again; where to begin?

Clock strikes eight; no time to wait
Frantic rush; a fleeting hush
See him once more; the voices soar
A few more sips; emotion grips

Now it’s ten; pick up a pen
Voices mocking; body rocking
Pen hits paper; emotions taper
One big swig; start to dig

Midnight chimes; a flood of rhymes
Then passion drains; ink marks just stains
No fucking point; roll up a joint
Spark; in; hold; out; then the pen begins to spout

Three o’clock; suddenly, shock
Tears stream, unleashed; restraint, deceased
Those things I saw; sick, savage, raw
The screams won’t stop; drain the last drop

Sun starts to rise; I see those eyes
Can’t let it go; that fateful glow
Hear sirens scream; afraid to dream

When blade cuts and stings

The mace does not dwell

on the malice it brings



The axe cannot weep

When red stains its head

The dagger cannot profit

From alley man dead



Fear not the shiv

the arrow or sling

Fear not the claymore

fit to slay kings



Fear but the Hand

and murderous sight

For anything's a weapon

tangled life
and your
promised words
are all I want.

To be there.
To be caught up.


To be twisted
and tangled in
your mind,
We heard them speak, and we heard them yell
""How smart they were, these arrangements of cells,
A Marlboro hangs from your lips
I wave at you smiling, “Hey Devin”
“It’s Dmoney” you say with a quip.


It’s here that you stand at attention.
Where I see you each time I come home.
I marvel at your great ascension,
At your Honda with spinners of chrome.


I’ll admit sometimes when I’m at college,
I picture your gold tooth and its gleam.
For what is my vast wealth of knowledge?
Compared to a girlfriend of sixteen.


Your Philosophy stands without Peer.
You’re brimming with YOLO and Swag.
And each time I come home I know you’ll be here,
God bless you, you small town dirtbag.
It’s her comehither stare
Demon horns underneath red hair
An unholy kiss across my lips.

“Oh,” I whisper, and she strikes.
It's her femmefatale tease
Pitchforks hidden in her sleeves.
A wicked tongue to leave me numb.

She’s the devil
And she had me at hell.

EDIT:
My friend loved that line so much that she made me this:

Second EDIT:


A sense of powerlessness runs through.



I'm sure we can all imagine how that went.








EDIT FOR CLARITY and SPECIFICALS:






His arms were spread out wide

The ground beneath grew closer

And at once he felt alive

The lonely world he lived in

Would be lost within this feat

He took a step and smiled

But this wicked world gives me a hunch,
They tell me not to bitch or whine
where I was quite gifted with rhyme
but that time was illspent
and it soon came and went
she was wearing nothing but an oversized tshirt
in the sundrenched room at dawn.
Leaning over
rifling through a yellow bag.
Her hair a tangled swirl of gold
framing her face aflame with light.
She emanated ice.
Pretending
as if I had never known
the perfect curve of her body
or the unbearable ache of her skin
or the smallness of her hands
when they tangled with mine.
She had intertwined our bodies,
tendrils of her honey hair
tickling my face and
wrapping around my heart as spiderwebs.
But the molten light of her eyes had enveloped all,
and as she drank the fiery blood of the sun,
while the prisons empty their halfdead
into your silken lap,
I see the fine whiskers of a rat
exploring my bottled and discouraged floor:
fat, fat, this crawling angel
and there is a book by Rimbaud and it
ignores the book by Rimbaud as
particles of the clock stick in my particle brain
like arrows working at old wounds
and christ I cannot pull them out.

you can take a butterfly and rip its wings,
you can take this room and run it through fire,
you can take my bones and paint them green
and hang them out the window like letters from Spain
but
I will be running down the hall of your granite heart
for years
and then,
with you,
not handinhand but equally sorry and poor and sad,
with all the victories and defeats
safely in the past,
we'll be
like bayonets in candlelight
the voices heard, now from behind:
I see I hear I am I see I hear I am I was I was
I still am this moment
this butterfly moment staring into the round deep
eye of an empty bottle
the shade moving in the wind like a hand
once here
and now gone.

I think I think
but not too hard
and take this paper from the machine

Years of silence drove me crazy.

Watching standup, didn't laugh.

Music plays, not sure which track.

Songs about the love I lack.

Sketches turn to blocks of black.

No great talent to fall back,

on when you're alone.

Confidence in self is low,

Wonder if my bluff will show.

You don't care, I know I know,

I know I'm not allowed to die.

Run away to be alone,

A melted mask, my face now shown.

Life speeds up when I get slow.

You don't care, I know I know,

Still not sure exactly why,

I know I'm not allowed to die.

Just can't give more than a grin,


Nightmares keep my feelings in.


Rotting teeth and peeling tongue,


Disgusted looks from everyone.


We live in different worlds you see,


Tortured souls live differently.


Stuck in place 'cuz I can't go,


You don't care, I know I know.


I've been fine.

Really, I have.

I don't think of you every waking moment.

I only think of you once a day.

But last night, I felt your kiss.

Last night, you invaded my dream.

This morning my pillow was damp.

This morning my eyes were sore.

I'm still okay.

I have to let you go.

Why won't you let me?

Edit:

I've been fine.

No, really. I have.

I no longer think of you, every waking moment.

Only when I stop to catch my breath.

I've been trying to outrun your memory for months.

I've been trying to forget.

But last night, I felt your kiss.

Last night, you invaded my dream.

This morning my pillow was damp.

This morning my eyes were sore.

I'm still okay.

I have to let you go.


I drink more than at 24.

They say drinking takes years off your life.


Love became me as my heart took to a girl that cuddled into a ball
and drew for hours with me watching
patiently,
because she found comfort in just knowing
someone was there.
Oblivious, or maybe
it was the tinted glasses, designed to slow
and simplify the growing, throbbing, pulsating,
hot, hot, needing world around her,
she couldn't admit it was too scary,
she just drew me instead.




Three months later I fell for a boy that took my word for truth
yet sat and pondered the origin of truth for hours.
Masturbation, or maybe
a patience that could appreciate what the fastmoving eye sped by
each day. Some other lover could have taken a drag,
and shared his gentle way but
I had no time for benefits of mind and body.




Five months past and then I was in the cross hairs of an
armed woman that had the strength to sprint
with ten thousand bricks on her back and
never quit, just set fire
to those who laid in her path.
So they kept on piling bricks and countless lovers were charred,
til I laid down, tripped her up, and watched the brick city fall.
Overwhelming, yes, constantly, but with a burning passion that
none had yet to survive.
I quit since she couldn't kill me.




It wasn't two weeks before I locked eyes with a boy that cried when I cried
and needed to be squeezed as tightly as possible, at least once a day.
I lead his roots to the clear, rushing brook and as he drank, I drank.
He grew, I replenished and that affair of friends came to an end.




Four years of finding true love
has left me
with a life description limited.
She was and He was has left me with

He does what comes natural, no need for a lesson.

He humps and he pumps, it lasts only seconds.

Still its more messy than all future sessions.

For we live and we learn; so never again

will the young boy finish all over his bed.

Instead he'll get smart, learn the ways of the sock

the toilet, the shower, outside on a rock.

It creeps people out, and its very taboo

yet everyone does it; John, Jill, even you.

So find a room private, lonely, and quiet;


strict no repetition rule on my meek

mentality, but unfortunately

my norepinephrine receptors have

weakened and neutered will to a still state

Where retrogressive productivity


The mismatch between
the Himalayan haystacks of data
and the limitations of the
human beings trying to
find the needles and
read them like tea leaves
is matched by the mismatch between
the datasurveillance state
and the panel charged with taming it.
Hendrick Hertzberg
drinks salt water
until he is mad.


The sickness seizes him.
The great barren blue
and the ceaseless sun
have worn his senses.


He wants to believe
the sweet shimmer,
the ideal island,
his perceived paradise.


The bright birds sing softly
calling from the cool canopy.
Beneath, the sun stops sizzling.
Life teems amidst the rolling desert.


His briny tears sting
his parched eyes
while he bobs up
and down
disoriented.


All there is, is to swim
and hope he lands
before the shimmer fades.
or he drowns.


A man stranded at sea
drinks salt water
until he is mad.


like how brown is my least favorite color

and how I actually prefer cloudy days.


How I've always wanted to make rock candy on strings,

ever since I saw Mary Catherine's sixth grade science fair project.

And how flowers make me feel lonely

because I never have anyone to give them to.

And how stupid and vain and egotistical I am

I guess all feelings are stupid and vain and egotistical.

But most of all I want to tell someone how I love to walk

through dead leaves at dusk and sit in a crowded room and make up

elaborate stories about everyone inside.

That's it.

No moral. No punchline. No Point.

And it felt great
I didn't think about your livid ginger hair
Or your freckle mosaic face that you see as a grotesque stain
I didn't think about your green feline eyes
Or your honest smile, without pretence, hidden because of an
impossible standard of “white”
I didn't think about your bubbly, agreeable ways
Or your full, sprightly laughter you find shrill and offensive
I didn't think about your sly wit
Or your hidden sordid past that makes you real and endlessly
fascinating
I didn't think about you today
She walks.
She walks with similes, steps like metaphors.
She walks away.
She walks away.
She walks away.

But How Are We Going To Raise The Money




Rape Joke

&gt; The rape joke is that you were 19 years old.

&gt; The rape joke is that he was your boyfriend.

&gt; The rape joke it wore a goatee. A goatee.


&gt; No offense.


&gt; Then suddenly you were older, but not very old at all.


&gt; The rape joke is he was a bouncer, and kept people out for a living.

&gt; Not you!


&gt; He wasn’t threatening you, you understood. He just really liked his knife.


&gt; How can a piece of knowledge be stupid? But of course you were so stupid.


&gt; The rape joke is that his best friend was named Peewee.

&gt; OK, the rape joke is that he worshiped The Rock.




&gt; It gets funnier.








&gt; Just like the body, which more than a concrete form is a capacity.











&gt; Can rape jokes be funny at all, is the question.


&gt; The rape joke cries out for the right to be told.

&gt; The rape joke is that this is just how it happened.


&gt;Admit it.
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
How charged with punishments the scroll.
I am the master of my fate:
I am the captain of my soul.

and: infinity minus two still comes out to infinity

I've never had a thought
as clever as that,
but this morning I noticed:
The city buses kind of
look like loaves of bread.

by the mathematician's formula,
that means absolutely nothing.
So that's something to
Leave your waitress well paid—
Don't forget you manners
In the cinema's shade.


Make her happy, make her laugh,
Make her smile like a fool.
Tell her that she's pretty
And love her as a rule.


Hug her when you first see her
And try to hold her near.
Pay attention to her jewelry—
The diamonds in her ears.


Talk about all the places
Someday maybe you'll go,
But don't make any promises
Because you never know—


Say goodnight and wish her off
To her cozy bed sheets;
Fill her heart and mind with clay
For her to mold her dreams.


Listen when she's speaking soft,
When her voice is choked.
You may not like the words you hear
But it's her who's left broken.


Love her even after
It seems she's gone away.
She's not coming back to you

I couldn’t count feet, stumbled iamb to

trochee. More concerned with your coffee cup

than all my microphone spoke poems, you

ignored my words, just sloppy, stuttered verse,

since you’d read Shakespeare’s, first name basis: Bill’s

entire works and he said it all first.

Said I should practice socalled scansion skills

or publishing was just a distant hope

‘cause I was listening to Tupac’s rhymes

while you were so preoccupied with Pope.

But fuck, guess what: these fumbled fourteen lines?

A sonnet, wrote it, you said I couldn’t,

in case you didn’t notice, you wouldn’t.
I saw her last night
boldstroked, brushmarked
against the swirling night air.
Tobacco brunette hair,
alit by soft neon.
Thoughts awash
in the jumble of twilight.
Love or whatever you call it,
is just whispers and alcohol.
A flood of feckless words


A long time on waters
No short length of hours
I've no carrier, no dove
But a message in a bottle
Receive my love
from here to then
to em, from anh


Legs crossed, hands folded and eyes forward.
You are a book, you are a coin, you are an unlit
cigarette, sheathed and unspent

perched on the edge, tensed, waiting to be flicked from the balcony
of your seat, legs unfolding and fingers stretching
for your resting place tonight.


It’s time, people of China! It’s time.
The Square belongs to everyone.
With your own two feet
It’s time to head to the Square and make your choice.

It’s time, people of China! It’s time.
A song belongs to everyone.
From your own throat
It’s time to voice the song in your heart.

It’s time, people of China! It’s time.
China belongs to everyone.
Of your own will
It’s time to choose what China shall be.


got you lost but

I’m glad I

got lost with you

If a time traveler swapped my adolescent brain I'd be asking you how.

How could you?

I've been racking my brain to find answers for years,

The pool of confusion you and mom created were built with my tears,

I remember laying in my bunk bed, wishing I didn't have ears

Because the things you were yelling at mom was too hard to hear.

I didn't understand.

My pillow was my microphone when I was speaking to God.

And my prayers were never audible because they came out in sobs.

And when my baby brother came to me for answers,

What do you say? The things I was thinking I couldn't convey.

He was your son, but he was my brother.

And for those rocky divorce years, we protected one another.

I sheltered him from the hate, the horrors of love,

But it's hard to do that when you're in the kitchen and we're above.

I've cursed the loft of our house a thousand times,

Being built for echoing, these vibrations seemed like crimes.

I didn't understand

""Don't listen to your mother, she's gone wrong in the head.

Everything you know about her, surely you've misread.

I don't know where we'll live son, but I'll figure it out.

Just don't tell your brother; it's nothing to worry him about.""

When I heard that, I felt like a desert. You deserted me.

And back then I thought I deserved it, the blame was easy to see.

Maybe if I cleaned my room more and did chores around the house,

You'd put the bottle down and not fight with your spouse.

I was a lost cause, but my brother was still pure,

So I protected him at all costs, I had to ensure

He wouldn't wind up like me.

Fucked in the head, no sign for a cure.

But looking back on it years later, it wasn't my fault.

I want to blame you but I love you with all my heart.

I want to hate you but where can I start?

The feelings I had when I was a kid can't be erased

But the emotions I have now seem like they can't be faced.

So I pick up the bottle and start to take your place.

I realize now how you dealt with yourself,

Grabbing another beer bottle from the top of the shelf.

It feels good for now, and I've got all night.

And when tomorrow rolls around, in the booze, I'll take flight.
marking the times I've cried
a little burgundy paperback
thin as a needle


tucked away
in the drawer behind little spools




Say where does your Homeland begin for you?
With pictures on ABC cards,
With old and reliable friends of yours,
Who live in the neighboring yards?
But maybe it starts with the cradlesong
Your mother once hummed low and sweet,
The memories that no one can take from you,
Whatever ordeals you may meet.


Say where does you Homeland begin for you?
With your favorite bench by the tree,
The slender and beautiful birch in the field
That bends to the wind blowing free.
But maybe it starts with the blackbirds’ songs,
Spring chorus rejoicing the day,
The old country lane that you love so dear,
That fades in horizons of gray…


Say where does your Homeland begin for you?
With windows lit up far away,
With Father’s starred helmet brought home from the war,
We found in the attic one day.
But maybe it starts with the tune of the wheels
As hammered on rails by the train.
With youth’s sacred vow that you swore to Her,
That day when your heart was aflame…
Say where does you Homeland begin for you?

.

Two jims diverged in a yellow wood,

And sorry I could not rustle both

And see them rustling, long I stood

Considering one as long as I could;

I must fulfill my rustle oath.

.

Then took the other, as just as fair,

And having perhaps the better jims,

They needed rustling, that much was clear;

But as for that, the rustling air

Had roused them really about the same,


.

And both that morning still remained

As jims no force had rus'd about.

For now my rustling was restrained

To the latter, though I could not feign

Return, for I was fraught with doubt.

.

I shall be rustling with a sigh

Some jims ages and ages hence:

Two jims diverged in a wood and I,

I rustled those less rustled by,

And that has made all the difference.

now, this is only my opinion, mind you,

but I think

That you are smoke and a mirror
and a card up your sleeve
but I have a bad habit of making magicians out of molehills

and the only thing keeping me here
is that one last word that you've hidden

right

under

your tongue.

You wore a loose floral shirt
that was transparent enough
to show off a svelte frame
that must have held
a fancy picture.


Stop it. You know I'm not
good enough for you.

That's why I don't let you buy marlbros and
You can't try drugs you never heard of.

Your friend's leggings and uggs
said that she gives lazy blowjobs.
Just allows a flaccid noddle
to sit motionless under her tongue...
This is not the place to die for you.
so please enjoy your stay
if there is anything I can do to make things
more comfortable,
ask for Battery at the concierge desk.

They say I should stop smoking
these cigars, it will kill me.
Fools!
That is the reason to smoke.
Suicide should be very
slow and enjoyable.

Have you ever sat
completely still, alone,
naked, in your backyard
while it is raining?
Close your eyes as you do so,
love life so intensely
that yours becomes insignificant
and the preservation of theirs,
the thriving of theirs!!
becomes milk and honey.


Rebecca Cook





in the world


could never fill this

empty space

next to me at

like I am a mother and I am a sick child,
I burn my fingers
and when the vapor disappears
I only have bitter brown water

and sometimes it feels good
to fail at simple things.
The cold water refreshes the burn so well
it is better than no burn at all
First as if nothing is a miracle,
and stare up into the night sky and see swirls of rock and dust.
Or as if everything is a miracle,

So what am I missing, what have I lost?
I wander in the shadows, seeking the light,
Who am I missing tonight?

Was he in the crowd, did we pass in the street?
Were we on the same train, did our eyes ever meet?
Would knowing the truth make anything right?
Who am I missing tonight?

Does he think of the girl he never met?
How cruel fate is to show no regret.
Alone with his thoughts, does he dim the light
And wonder who he's missing tonight?

Now my hair is gray, my looks are gone,
Through crowded streets I walk alone.
Remembering my youth, my thoughts take flight,
I’m not what we thought I was
Every drop and every sip of you is like another death
All over again like every other time

I wanted to die and now it hurts to speak
Like I can hardly squeeze out a penstroke to describe
The incredible, astronomical pain you cause me

If I could turn tears to wine I would drink them
My old friend, you and I have seen so many new deaths
So many sleeping fits and insomniatic bouts

Of insanity that I could hardly confine, here I am
Here is I so tired and tired and tired and giving it all away

My god and my killer, my slow and morbid murder that
Creeps its way into my eyes like a plague which unwraps me
And ties me up again in the most illogical ways

A pressure beats behind my skull like a stave
Containing ten hot notes and twenty hard beats
With a rhythm I can hardly contain

In the confined space between the walls of a glass
Between lid and bottle and the start
Of a new kind of agony, with every new seal

Broken, like all my former promises
And every pledge I made to myself
Every confession of disorder and dedication to reform

I yawn, now as I take a sip and down the final glass
For the evening, somewhere between eleventeenth and last
Vessel of pure poision that I cannot refuse

I cannot put down this fucking, opiate glass
This transparent demon in whose claws is clasped
My still slowed and dulled yet raw and beating heart

Whose ventricles do reject me as if I
The lover,  donor, occupant, tumour benign
Whose eyes claw for a new quip, pun, line

To exemplify the heinous terror I describe
Delirium tremens worms its way into my mind
Rots away my brain until I can no longer stigmatise

My actions with a sublime kind of fuckedupness
That exists beyond the watchful, aryan eye
Of my bastard father who drinks of this turbid swamp of mine

Paris is like a faraway island, a place where there is much better wine
For a cheaper price and a song for the throat of a singing bird
Pardon me, sir, but I find your interjections utterly absurd

What disturbed the lifelong comalike sleep I carved
Like a cave into the street where my casing curiously parked
Like a suburban nightmare broken down and writeoff sedan car

The last hour was ticking by like sand on sand
And my gospels lies, prayers jumped from hand to hand
To envelop the simple death I understand

In an ethereal vine that god himself
Could not force to bring forth the rose
Once again the miserable sod revolved and in a mystery took repose
I'd download barrels full of gas
I'd download the current Drivers for the car
So I could make sure I was able to escape the Cyber Police

Fuck it! If I could,
I'd download some of those sluts, whores, and milfs from Redtube and Youporn
Because why not? They're cheaper than the real thing

I wouldn't download social policy change
Who has the time for that?
I wouldn't download universal healthcare
Think of all that bandwidth it would take up (I have only enough for me)

I'd download a better computer
I'd download a computer hardware group to make me that better computer

I think I might download social policy change
To make me ruler of the world

I'd download Morgan Freeman to read this poem
I'd download Jackie Chan to go to bar fights with me
I'd download Chuck Norris just so I could delete him

Hell! If I could,
Because why not? They're cheaper than the real thing

Just don't ask me to seed any plants or food
I don't have time for my peers (who does?)

I'd download a house
I'd download a white picket fence
I'd download paid bills and filled tax forms
Just so I could keep the house

Yeah! If I could,
Because why not? They're cheaper than the real thing

I would download all these things
But I can't because life is unfair
I should first download justice

Or perhaps some episodes of Judge Judy
I protected you though I knew
that your jellybean manifestation
would be short lived
you crawled inside my womb
and grew like a tree
for six weeks
and for lack of a better word I called you
“foetus”
As I watch the beauty of
pregnant women as they
expel the screaming mass of human
I could have also
maybe six months ago
I weep with joy as the bluish,
wet, warm body bursts forth
its not that I wish to know you
its that I wish to hold you
like I held you for that
one month and one half
and you made me ill
made me decide that I hated prawns
the eggs he cooked me churned
forth from my mouth
like you could have churned forth
from my cunt
I will always miss you, my love
but letting you go was right
it was best I never threw you
haphazardly into the light
I might miss you again
when my own child slides out
of my body
like a missile aimed
towards the sun
I am now plagued with thoughts
of what it might feel like
to slalom through those hot nine months
nine months and I could have found you, love
I could have felt your heartbeat, love
more than just the dischargesheet, love
more than my eighty beats per minute, love
I'll pray to you as I shove
the waiting hand of my midwife
away
to catch your glittering crown
to hold your head in the palm
of my hand
to pull you forth into the world
and at last am glad
to feel you
to hold you to my breast
to let you slip away

A quiet warmth ticks in my hand

Clockwork talks and clockwork speaks

It talks of hours, it talks of weeks

And as death turns his hourglass

the clockwork ticks and hours pass

I look him right in his hollow eye

I wind the clockwork and wave goodbye
Made love to a pelican’s beak.
Now the guys that she tries
Can’t surprise with their size
Nor with their prosaic technique.

We did such silly things.




Like how I called your telephone,




And filled up your answering machine.




Your parents always got annoyed, but for you, I never stopped.


It's been a while since we spoke, but I think of you a lot.





I visited you today, left flowers under the tree.


I still call you every night,


And dread your phone won't ring.




It's nice to hear your voice still, pretend you're here with me...



or the hint of hazelnut my grandmother puts in her apple pies.

I couldn't say whether your smile was bright with confidence,

or warmly humble.


how it pushed outward in a childlike way,

yet thinned around your left earlobe in a way that showed age in hardships.


in such a way that I forgot to look to see who you were,

I put my hand on a hot stove
directly after being told not to.


Perhaps if I had any memory of this,
or if my hand held any scars,

Whose limericks had only two lines

That man isn't me, but don't expect more

at once too young and too old to be 30.
Shall I resign myself to labor?
Something about the question exhausts him,
so he decides to take a nap
for the next twentythree years.
Wake my husband!
You’ve a wife and child.
Oh, your restless spirit, she says.
And she tucks him in,


I'm not in it for the karma  this is a selfpost.

I'm not in it for the money  the application is free.




Enjoy,
Stoned|benotƧ


As did I the day
Perhaps if I just wait
Tomorrow will go away.

I looked for God
In rivers and in people
In North Carolina
And in Oregon
And some places in between;

I could never find anything
But books
And poems and stories
And sex and music
And war and death
And everything else

And on the bus, a boy
Maybe five or six or seven
Says in Vietnamese,
""My stop is at 82nd""
And in English,

that the gophers need to die

and go out stuffing their holes with deadly  vitamins.

If he does, and finds my millions of

cigarette butts poked down and covered like

juvenile landmines,

I hope the cloudlike mixture of

senility and wisdom that has been

pouring droplets of time into my mind

will pause,

and chuckles will rise like dew

into his old mouth while he

stands and imagines gophers

chainsmoking down in caverns like

lonely afterhour dwarves.

thoughts?



by the five dollar bill that appeared from nowhere
in your suitcase while you bathed in the sink.

When you came back and asked who did it,
I couldn't confess.

The way your skin was draped over your bones
I wanted to iron it out.
I wanted to wash your stained glass eyes
And prune the years off of your gnarled fingers.

I wanted to restore the frescoes of your faith,
And bless again the water
that you were baptized in.





her appetite crushed by words of hate.


She felt the pain, so easy at first, She never thought to fear the worst.

She ate less now, the cuts were deeper, and no one even tried to keep her

She dyed her hair, she hid her eyes,
No one responded to desperate cries.





If your life's a mess and you want to die, open a book or give writing a try.



like the gods are really in your corner
Even the American flag looks sort of pretty
and a full days rain increases your happiness
The sun is only on the other side
of the clouds
and somewhere, a farmer's been praying.
Some days there is nothing that seems
urgent or temporary
and you see flowers as if for the first time
and you tell the sky that you're in love
with a girl, and the folks on the bus don't
seem so far away
and lines on a map do not seem so permanent
The kind of day that makes you
want to create something lovely.

On behalf of all poets,
playwrights, and musicians,
I apologize;

but you do not embody beauty,
nor, the freshest of roses,
the richest of diamonds,
or a summer’s day.

This is disingenuous,
not to beauty,
but to you.

Without you, roses
would just be weeds, diamonds,
worthless chunks of carbon, and a summer’s day,
a sweaty working condition.

Without you, I would never know
of beauty, love, compassion, loyalty, and


I would never get laid.

Playfully yours,
Sousedpoet

Those were the days,
Soldiers and Dragons
Knights and Death Rays.

Army Men scattered
Across the sand,
Plastic carnage
Littered the land.

Dragons roar
with Deadly Fire,
Our heroes fate
Looks most dire.

The knight he fought
with skill and grace,
All for a kiss
Upon his face.

Those were the days
to be a child,
run, jump, play,
laugh and be wild.

Now I sit here
at this job,
All my creativity
is robbed.

My heart yearns
to be a kid,
Soldiers and Dragons

It would probably be filled with apologies.

I'm sorry Mom, I'm sorry Dad.

I'm sorry I couldn't be the son you wanted.

I'm sorry I lacked the motivation the be the son you wanted.

I'm sorry I was constantly hurting.

I'm sorry depression tangled me and forced me

Into something I never thought I'd be.

I'm sorry exgirlfriends.

I'm sorry I wasn't what you were looking for.

I know how to be a good man.

But I'm sorry I couldn't be your prince.

I'm sorry I couldn't be what you idealized.

Your knight in shining armor. Your hero.

I'm sorry I couldn't save you from yourself.

If I wrote a suicide note,

It probably wouldn't be a poem.

It would probably list my failures,

and be a long list of apologies

talking about how I had a lot of potential

about how I didn't use it as well as I could of

About how I had a lot of pressure of me on the time

About how I couldn't find my real self amongst everyone else.

It would list all my failures and not my triumphs.

If I wrote a suicide note,

I would probably grow angry.

I would be angry about everything.

About how college debt killed me.

About how a 4 year long relationship ruined me.

About how drugs and alcohol solved the mysteries of life for me.

About how happy I am now that I'm dead.

About how I thought I knew true friends, but that surely

I know nothing at all.

About my first romance

About the time I lost my virginity at 15 when I was drunk

About love

About waste

About neglect

About how I wish I was born again

How I wish I could start again.

How I could write my wrongs in this life

How I could find a beautiful wife.

Because that's all I want in life.

To love and be loved.

But there's nothing left.

Just an empty shell and people picking around.

Wondering how a dead man is laying on the ground

that you can see it in the slow movement of
the hands of a clock.

people so tired
mutilated
either by love or no love.

people just are not good to each other
one on one.

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

that we can all be

why is everyone diagnosed with depression?
it's all an illusion

Does age even matter?
I was nine,
I guess my doctors decided it was my time

Can you describe what you're feeling,

yes.  confused.

I think we have another pill just for you

Distracted in school?
Swallow these

why can't you just let me breathe?

I was only nine

too afraid to speak, so I just day dream

about peace and a life at ease

a simple cut, or just one sqeeze

instead of a simple remedy,

they use use us as pawns, so we pay their fees

They should have told me the truth, ""you're just shy""

but they built me up, labeled it social anxiety, lie after lie.

I hit the breaking point

I have to let go

almost six years of this fucking show

every year, a new season

every year the same exact reasons





I just recently realized all of this.

almost born behind bars
if im honest with you
there werent idols or art

abandoned by a mother
empty at heart
leisons and seizures
smashed windows of cars

run down bedsits
ever present scars
never taught to look up
never taught to chase stars

if you question any motive
if you hide beind charts
just know we're fucked up

To love someone that doesn't love you back?

Is it possible,

To forget and move on?

To get with the saying

""Life goes on?""

Or

""There's a lot of fish in the ocean?""

""Like I have to go with the motion.""

But it's not possible

To forget and move on.

When even though you weren't even mine,

You laugh, you sing, you dance, you fly.
It looks so fun, I want to try.
But as I start, that dog, jet black,
Has seized my mind and pulled me back.

I think I cannot take the chance,
That he should mock my silly dance.
I know him wrong, and make the choice,
To disregard his jeering voice.

We start to dance, our bodies tight,
As I reflect your carefree light,
And I clutch tight that foreign thought,
That past and future mean but naught.

My heart believes this honest lie.
For just one beat I thought we'd fly.
I lost what I had thought I'd found.
We tried, but could not leave the ground.

You cannot lift my heavy weight.
It isn't you, it's me I hate.
It's out of mind, but still I know.
I try and try but can't let go.

I wish I could remember more.
The way you smelled, the dress you wore.
Those memories have turned to fog,


always put an extra teaspoon of sugar

on his Cheerios or that he couldn't sleep without telling his wife

how much he loved her. None of this leaves

a permanent footprint on any surface

until it's a part of our past. Not even

a halfbaked foot print in the red clay

of our neighbors' vegetable garden while our best friend

laughs hysterically with the harvest moon

because she never was good at hideandseek. And for some reason,

we paperclip that moon on the wall next to our Metro

Map of Paris to think of something original or insightful.

Because it's a little like stealing to say

that 'you begin to think about how all the stars in the sky

are dead' and still that 'space is a mystery

just like death. It can be dark and lonely but it can be beautiful

too.' Rather, when a razor hits the moon

it bleeds silence. And still

it hurts; to speak too soon,

to act too slow. I'd rather step on leaves

than step on toes. But he doesn't care.

The Galaxy is like a pair of Jamanji dice;

bent on counting the cards. Your tour guide is nothing more

than a hitch hiker brandying his thumb

in the night sky. He tries to escape, calling out

to the naïve but when I answer

his tide of transfixation

doesn’t bring us any closer.

When our first moon walker leaves home

for the morgue, a universe of tradition is being buried

six feet under. I am not afraid to keep on living

with the words still unspoken

because I see them permeate the page in invisible ink.

The night of what is has been chizzled

into stone but the dawn of what's to come is sealed

in candle wax.
if you wanted.

You could have me
if you asked.

In case of an emergency,
we provide a hammer
and hope you
In the first breath of a season I’d never known
Somewhere between Winter and Spring

An imperfect bubble popped
And we spilled out
Tumbling into view

I was ineloquent laughter,
You, unspeakable truth.

Denying the shape or forms of clouds
Or thoughts of welcome proof.
You made a gift of the morning sun,
Inspired me in unknown tongues,
And peeled apart the moon.

My midnight,
Layer by layer,
Became you.
Which whispered in the wind, a lonely sound they grieved
Weaved within bare branches of birch they perched like birds


Pale hands turned talons, frail bones cleaved to leaves
Leaving life like fall, finally and quietly falling asleep

But she lay listless under the covers,
containing a sweltering heat.

Get up. I said again
as I sat down on the side of the bed,
inhaling on a cigarette.

I pushed her bare shoulder
that peaked from under white sheets
and they fell, melted
and pooled against her skin like
first snow.

I stood, already dressed
in brown slacks and jacket,
a hat with a thrush's feather pinned to it
(the one she pinned
when we were in the park
some years ago).

Back then, I would have never
thought I'd ever look down at her.
We were meant to be equals,
moving along the same track,
the destination unknown;
but we knew it was bright
like a single streetlight
at the end of a tunnel.

My father once told me simply:
You don't always get
what you expect to get.

And I look at her now and
how she failed
to grow with me.

No, no.
No.
I shook my head.
Maybe it was me,
all along  never
helping her along,
never catching
the sparks of a flint.

I sighed smoke,
leaving her to smoulder
under covers, and I,
to retreat to a new day
of what ifs and
what could have beens,
knowing though,
that I would settle for
what is and
what will never be.

the gentleman in the padded chair
with a reasonable gut and a handlebar mustache
who had lost a fortune in the housing bubble
and moved north, where it was wet

who had also worked in China,
in another life, for a company
more famous than Coke or Superman
(he often talks about how much money
and how little time for his children
that job provided)—

When I was young, he tells me
and we've had this conversation before
and I did what I could to be humble
and listen, that time, and the time before
but now I'm bored, because at 36
when men his age talk to me like I'm 24

and like I haven't spent the last two decades
failing at what I've wanted to do
and starting over, and failing again
and filling boxes with marked up pages
and starving and eating shit
and finally giving up
only to have what I want to do
become the only thing I can

But when I admit that art
is what I make, they ask how much money
that pays,
and when I say none they send me links
to job offers, and talk
about how hard it was for them to make
a living, as an artist, so when kids came
art, not food, was sacrificed
and now he says

When I was young,
and I know I should forgive him
and be respectful, but still
defiance is what I'm good at
and defiance is what keeps me
ten years younger
than I am


When you said “no”

I heard “maybe”

I heard “tomorrow, yes

tomorrow I will want you

Today I am scared

Today I am confused”

But I think I understand now

You meant “no”

Your eyes lied to me

Bedroom eyes

It’s hard to lie next to you

To smell your breath

And not think that you want me.


Your eyes are deep, unknown

Your eyes do not belong to you

They belong to a lover,

A man with soul and heart.

They are too sensual for you,

silly virgin.

Your lips are much too pink

For your asexual body.

Your lips are in Spanish, I swear

Eyes in French,

Yet your brain is in binary.



I could get lost in ones and zeros

I’m sure

If you let me in,

Perhaps I could

In my soul
And the lights are never off.

There's a kitchen sink
And places for little things;
Memories of a Christmas Eve in '93.

A Christian guy who spoke to me once
In a church that made me feel uncomfortable.

Volley ball in the dark on the beach.

Having trouble trying to sleep.

There's a home
In my soul
And the lights are never off.

My first kiss
Was on the wrist
By a girl who shares the namesake of my Mom.

And since I lost her
I've been an imposter
But I think this glass will give him a reason to run.

When we called 911 because the neighbour's kid was blue
And when we visited grandma because she was, too.

Sex on the lawn with my best friend.

Though I didn't have one back then.

Not knowing I'd be thinking about it 10 years later
Over and over again.

There's a home
In my soul.
And the lights never go off.

It's big and it's clean
But it's messy, like me.
And the lights are always on
the hope
in the corner of my eye
the face in the crowd
that disappears
on second glance
the default daydream
and you have
no idea

As time brought the paradise of your breath,
It too will bring the loss of all losses—
For life, if defined well, must mention death—
That crime, born of necessity, tosses


Such volleys of such sorrow, some must land.
And though they give a pause, a thousand suns
still burn that night, away, far from the sand
Of Boston's shores. Such a cause, such grief He funds,


And therefore, our hands, though strong, can't stretch
Themselves to stop the ticks of fate of lives—
Instead we must see color when all's etched
in black, and taste honey when served the hive.


Because a sword, though sharp, fits in a sheath
And arrows soar on the same air we breathe.







Loving, living, caring, unique

Mistake, apology, tears roll down,

Resentment, fighting, running around.

Children, diapers, toys and things

Tired and stressed about everything.

Fight, hate, drink, and cry

Everything makes me want to die.

Apology, shell, cold, hard

Crying, lonely, scared, and marred.

This is the story of my life,

It is about how I lost my wife.

she puts his tongue in her mouth


chokes for its life.


An hour ago, I was lying in my bathtub
wishing away the truth


behind a locked door
hands cupped to my ears


singing lyrics to myself
to drown


out his shouts.
He was threatening me with the law


to trap my attention. He fought his hurt
by throwing weapons my direction.


My words cracked,
“We live in a beautiful world. Yeah we do, yeah we do.”


A voice cannot sing
when it is cinched by a closing throat.


I thought, it feels as though
the rope is on the wrong side of the skin.


Or the side right enough to keep me alive
and wrong enough to keep me wishing I’m not.


Death became
my body floating in a white cloth,


all emotions gone.
Only gold glitter and air.


To imagine this as a better state than real life
is scary. Real life is scary.


Now these tears are nothing but salt.
Waterless, life will not be as it was.


Life is never as it was.
When the shackles lift,


the ball and chain of loneliness
lock into place.


“Leave”, I kept screaming,
and finally he did.


Finally, with everything I ever hated. He left
behind everything I’d ever want.


Missing, I couldn’t miss him more.
Not written for me

I saw the words of a disillusioned woman
Who gained the world and threw it back,
But they could have been
The manifesto of my generation
Or footnotes in the text of a Roman tragedy,
Whispered to a fattened audience
Between scenes

I listened to a tale
Of a Koi fish that swam upstream,
Beating its flesh against the rocks,
To the top of a wicked mountain
It leapt over the gate
And was transformed into a dragon
Whose scales could stop arrows

I looked into a mirror
That did not show my reflection
And laughed at me for thinking
That I was the only one

treading to stay afloat,

alone,

scared,

mad.

Eventually the anchors weighing on you won the battle and pulled you
down

down

down.

You plummeted into the cold deep waters of your own psyche,

as you watched the world as you knew it disappear behind a glassy
sheet of water.

Darkness soon enveloped your mind.

Your sense of time, direction, and reality had vanished.

The abyss has swallowed you whole

and

there is no telling if you will ever see the sun again.


faint images uncoil around you

left in heaps upon old words

and whispers of love

that i so carefully left

in your pockets for rainy days.

shed skins and memories

twisted and tweaked in a trail

so long that somewhere on it

i lost you, to a world that convinced you

it could love you more


Floating above me and beside

And though my heart’s surrendered

She comes and goes in tides



Body not under my fingers

Words crossing the miley wires

Her kiss still burns and lingers

Lovingly taking me higher



I long to run my lips cross her cheek

Rememorize her face intently

Look at her soul in her eyes

And love, love, love, her so gently



Stopping, stalling, and moving

Pressing on like the coming sun

Her presence balming and soothing


My father once said
“working is what defines a man”
“the harder you work,
the more success finds you”
""women love a man that works”


So I tighten my nonslips
and shuffle onto the tile
“the more success finds you”
“women love the working
man”


So I button my
uniform
and shuffle onto tile
“working hard shows
you have character”


The girl I love
I don’t think knows
because I’m always at
work
and she is too

She also has a boyfriend
that doesn’t have a car
and always rides passenger
because
“women love the working man”

…my father always would
say




I've been coming here for years.
When I get too wild,
When I become untame,
I come in
For a trim.
A civilizing snip.

The scissors ever sharp,
The razors never dull,
The old man never ages,
The conversation never changes.

""How's life, Mack?
It's been a while; knew you'd come back.""
""It's a jungle out there.""
The old man nods, pats his chair...

All the while, outside;
Always arising,
Always progressing,
Always advancing.
All lies. All illusion.

The pole is only spinning
It's only spinning.
It's not like it's going anywhere.

I've been coming here for years...

weld your lips to mine, that we
become a soldered sculpture
preserving that moment in time.

Allow your waist to be the final restingplace
of my left hand, and let your hair
do its best to bury alive my right.
When we kiss, drowned out are

the living streets of Liverpool,
we're not surrounded by a thousand
bustling chaotic neighbours
we're an island

in perfect isolation,
shielded from it all
by an ethereal barrier of love;
there's no worry, or stress  just us.



We looked, we loved, and therewith instantly
Death became terrible to you and me.
By love we disenthralled our natural terror
From every comfortable philosopher
Or tall, grey doctor of divinity:
Death stood at last in his true rank and order.


It happened soon, so wild of heart were we,
Exchange of gifts grew to a malady:
Their worth rose always higher on each side
Till there seemed nothing but ungivable pride
That yet remained ungiven, and this degree
Called a conclusion not to be denied.


Then we at last bethought ourselves, made shift
And simultaneously this final gift
Gave: each with shaking hands unlocks
The sinister, long, brassbound coffinbox,
Unwraps pure death, with such bewildernment
As greeted our love's first accomplishment.

You're beautiful, adorable.
You're dazzling, magnificent.
You're wonderful, sensational.

These words aren't good enough for you,
but then, none are  least, not today.
Someday they'll make language anew,
perhaps with some more worthy way

To tell a girl she's marvelous.

See? Those ones aren't even close.
Merely ""a girl""? That's carelessness.
And ""marvelous""? No! How morose!

All words look bleak next to a star,
a nymph, a rose, a brand new car.
while average descriptions bore,
one can come close with metaphor.

You're sand through toes; You're angels' skin;
a monarch's prose; a fish's fin.
You're sirens' song; birds' mating call.
A lonely throng; an heirloom doll.

I wish that I could tell with ease
you you're in all my dreams. It seems
quite difficult just to relate
I like it a lot.
But I cant say the same for little Timmy wiltzadott.

Little timmy was so excited to boldly go
Where no little kid has gone before

To the bottom of the ball pit!
He yelled with glee!
So he pedeled his shwin to the nearest Chuckecheese.

He jumped in the pit!
He swam and he faught!
3 days later, they never found

I like you best when you're at your weakest,
when you're a pale blue after image of where
coal went falling through water, forgotten
apart from the dark, swirling pigment that slowly rises
and sparks flashes of recognition which prove catalyst
to a hoard of almost memories sighed away before fully realised.

you are the music from two doors down
that they play loud when they make love or they fight
only just audible through our walls
with words missed out and muffled as though sung through pillows,
softened by distance, emotion ghosts out to us from a past time,
a faded passion; each syllable a brittle reminder of former strength.

and you halfsmile with eyes halfshut and you feel the world—
more than I ever could or will—following you home through the dusk.
you are secondhand smoke, a halfasleep whispered secret in bed
too little

too fat
too thin
or nobody.

laughter or
tears

haters
lovers

strangers with faces like
the backs of
thumb tacks

armies running through
streets of blood
waving winebottles
bayoneting and fucking
virgins.

or an old guy in a cheap room
with a photograph of M. Monroe.

there is a loneliness in this world so great
that you can see it in the slow movement of
the hands of a clock.

people so tired
mutilated
either by love or no love.

people are just not good to each other
one on one

the rich are not good to the rich
the poor are not good to the poor.

we are afraid.

our educational system tells us
that we can all be
bigass winners.

it hasn't told us
about the gutters
or the suicides.

or the terror of one person
aching in one place
alone

untouched
unspoken to

watering a plant.

people are not good to each other.
people are not good to each other.
people are not good to each other.

I suppose they never will be.
I don't ask them to be.

but sometimes I think about
it.

the beads will swing
the clouds will cloud
and the killer will behead the child
like taking a bite out of an ice cream cone.

too much
too little

too fat
too thin
or nobody

more haters than lovers.

people are not good to each other.
perhaps if they were
our deaths would not be so sad.

meanwhile I look at young girls
stems
flowers of chance.

there must be a way.

surely there must be a way we have not yet
thought of.

who put this brain inside of me?

it cries
it demands
it says that there is a chance.

it will not say
""no.""

He in water, I on sand.

in the simplicity of destiny
you buried your frailty carefully
to conceal your fragile humanity,
and if I’d never seen how readily
your skin succumbs to kisses,
or how your breath shatters
at a well placed whisper,
or even how a delicate touch
can effortlessly break your will,
I’d never know that you
were made to be loved
are all that I will ever need
the caffeine and nicotine
are flowing through my veins


I sit and think of all the ways
my apathy and my malaise
have kept me from seizing my days
with no end in sight


This thought it keeps me up at night
although I'm above average height
I just cant stack up to the might
of those I do adore


Those cigarettes they to abhor
I tell myself ""well just one more""
""just one more smoke out my back door""
""Its just a little flame""


""Carpe diem"" they exclaim!
I still have no way to explain
why I experience this shame
I cant go out my door


I ask myself ""why not one more?""
""I could just finish my last four""
this answer I should just ignore
I feel like I'm a joke


My lungs will still expand with smoke
I do enjoy the many tokes
I cant blame the tobacco folks
I can only blame myself


(I'm not sure if this makes as much sense as it did when I was writing it)



I figured out how to scream without a voice

I was angry without feeling a thing

I messed up while doing everything by the rules

I cried without tears

I murdered without a gun

I did the impossible without getting off the fucking couch

Now why the hell would I want to go back to being alive

When I don’t need anything to be dead

Recollections and a smile
Pillows and bedsheets in a heap
The leavings of a perfect while


Her unpainted face and perfect form
Ivory curves and somber pose
This moment: the eye of a storm
Before the wind of regret blows


Her hair this gale brushes aside
The dreaded waking comes about.
Shall our encounter, drunk with pride
Become a blotch we never tout?


Stirring eyelids, orbs shining blue
A lucid stare ice cold.
Her soul reflected in that hue
Shadows of stories never told

Afraid, you ponder rapid sadly
What you’re going to say
About how passion took you madly
Chased inhibitions far away


You steep in fear as she now stretches
Fearing a sev’ring painful word
Your nervousness her blue eye catches
She grabs your hand; doubts were absurd

I'd say, ""Shel, where do you get your rhymes?""

and then he'd say something profound and yet weird

athena! your words never left me.
as i approach this yet again
(the one thing that makes me
feel most like a husband)
as i bend
a hanger back and forth
fatiguing the metal till it breaks
suddenly, hot...
i fashion a tool to put a distance
between myself
and the stinking mystery
hair trapped in drains
becomes,
remembering my own father:
scooping the drain clean with
his fingers, his bare hands
soldier, stoic, peaceful survivor
of a lifetime of marriage
tossed the filth in a garbage can
washed his hands
and fell asleep

Age is limited; life is finite,
Your story must come to an end,
Material wealth will not aid you,
It is only your time that you spend.


Every hour and minute is counted,
No single second shall stray,
The hourglass grains keep on falling,
Time graciously ebbing away,


Apathy is the poison of lifetime,
Cherish each day on this Earth,
Yours is the gift of existence,

One girl

One boy

Just pain

No joy


One girl

One song

Guess what

Boy’s gone


No love

Big fight

More pain

No light


One heart

No soul

Missed kick

No goal


One boy

Closed door

Girl cries

No more.

to touch


[Let me explain, Love.]

In all the words I try,
silent syllables divide
the meaning from
the tip of tongue,
to hide in better writers' minds.

And every time I think:
“Yes! I've captured it!”
My meter's long
or the rhyme is wrong;
the ink
is dead and dry.

[For Love is a sly devil,
pretending to sleep and trying not to giggle
as you mumble to your dreams.
And then bringing it up over cereal
in the morning, so we can giggle together.]

Yet, day on day I hold
an honest ambush of the soul,
to shout ""Aha!
I have you now!""
ensnared,
by words enshrined.

But definition distilled in form,
and recognition from it born,
are simulacrum
like all that comes
from living caught in time.

[Love is a living beast,
like the dog eating baby bunnies
on the lawn
as you cry
and I breathlessly curse.]

Nevertheless,
if year by year pass by
as I spend them speechless,
with you,
my Life,
know I only wait
to find a way
to bind the wordlessness
that's captive in your eyes.

[Because Love is a roaring quiet,
the whitenoise tshirt chest sound,
drowning out the evening news,
dawdling towards
the murmuring warmth
of our winter's shared bed.]

Of sleeping until the sun goes down
And waking up to the moon kissing my lips
Instead of
You

Looks like another day
Of putting on my guilty crown
And one cup of coffee being sipped
Instead of


Already, in so little time,
I am compelled to write you more poetry
Than I ever felt for him

For the boy who I professed to love,
There were never any phrases
At risk of spilling over,
of flooding past my lips;

Rushed away in the makeshift vessels
Of tangled, wild, and willful words;
No desperate syllables were commandeered
To set any frantic feelings free

And I know your sleepy eyes
Will float through these lines and find no place to rest
(You'll send me edits, or a compromise
Because you think you know how words work best)

But that doesn't change the fact
That this morning, I am awake and unashamed
Waiting patiently, selfishly
For the credit, or the blame

Whatever these words earn me
Those are the wages I will take
It is important that these things are said
If only for honesty's sake

I am waiting for you to wake up and exist
Because even if we do not speak
You are my favorite part of today



Much better than today

Ill do these things tomorrow

Then, tomorrow’s what I say

But when I say tomorrow

Never seems to be more right

Because when every day’s today

Then never is tomorrow night

But I can't tell you

I'm afraid that if I tell you

I will die

I'm not afraid to die

I'm afraid that if I die

I have consumed while waiting for things
to get better
I don’t know how much wine and whisky
and beer
mostly beer
I have consumed after
splits with women—
waiting for the phone to ring
waiting for the sound of footsteps,
and the phone to ring
waiting for the sounds of footsteps,
and the phone never rings
until much later
and the footsteps never arrive
until much later
when my stomach is coming up
out of my mouth
they arrive as fresh as spring flowers:
“what the hell have you done to yourself?
it will be 3 days before you can fuck me!”

the female is durable
she lives seven and one half years longer
than the male, and she drinks very little beer
because she knows it’s bad for the figure.

while we are going mad
they are out
dancing and laughing
with horny cowboys.

well, there’s beer
sacks and sacks of empty beer bottles
and when you pick one up
the bottle fall through the wet bottom
of the paper sack
rolling
clanking
spilling gray wet ash
and stale beer,
or the sacks fall over at 4 a.m.
in the morning
making the only sound in your life.
Beer rivers and seas of beer
the radio singing love songs
as the phone remains silent
and the walls stand
straight up and down

You’ll pry open the cupboard
timidly, so that no one else can hear.
You’ll find a thought once untouched
and then another
ad infinitum.

You’ll find everything you need
to reinvent the Universe
from scratch.

You’ll want to wake the others up
for a midnight snack
and perhaps one last supper
but they’ll be asleep
in the garden
shrouded by the mist
of the Lotus flowers.

So you’ll take it in solitude,
hunched over the breakfast table
flicking casually through
human history,
no longer making excuses for the ink
that will collect on your finger like a mountain
I wandered till I lost my way

I roamed into a hollow tree
and questioned where my path could be.


My life had brought me little joy,
and Nature made me Satan's toy

A heap of ashes was my bed.
The Devil's home was in my head

My knees were weak. I kissed the ground
and prayed that Wisdom could be found.



I swallowed and the world was new.
My ravaged frame knew what to do

I danced the dance of endless years
and boxed the furry rabbit's ears

The sky was Drunk! The endless sea
was Soma's crimson canopy

The air was gold, the land was green,
and foolish Satan could be seen

A hill of leaves, a window pane
the Prince of Demons was insane

I said, ""Belial, I stand inside
your empty heart: you cannot hide.""

Said Satan: ""Poor, redundant fool,
you're Selfish Soma's simple tool

This echoridden empty hall
is not my blessed heart at all

Accept my eyes and you will see:
you live inside a hollow tree!""

The King of Lies had spoken well.
That tree had been my living Hell

That lonely, weathered rotted tree
that prison was the world to me

My rage had helped me burrow through,
then Reason told me what to do

I stood beside that lonely tree
that frail, hollowed effigy

And said: “My tree has lost its roots.
My Soul remembers tasting fruits""

I hacked its limbs and cleaved its head.
I killed the fruitless sylvan Ted

And to its bones I brought the Flame,
and felt my Soul become the same

I said a prayer for wasted years,
and burned away my baseless fears



So that was what I used to be,
that lonely, weathered, hollow tree

That blazed upon its funeral pyre:
I was that tree  but now I'm Fire.


To prove my point I'm just typing
out some random stuff to show you

what happens when you don't use punctuation
this is meant to be a new sentence but in reality
because I didn't punctuate properly you had to read
and are continuing to have to read this all as if it is
one massively long sentence with no commas or full stops
which it really shouldn't be
You see sometimes people think just a capital letter is enough
but no punctuation means no stops
and after a while you lose the meaning behind
your poem


Another point, beware the ellipsis...


1.  Denote the omission of a word or phrase
2.  Indicate an unfinished thought, or trailing off into nothing
3.  Inspire a feeling of melancholy longing






Are serving a sentence

For mixing their tenses.


While my pen

Pleads repentance

For its pompous pretences.


Silly little Bic

Went a tad overboard

When declaring itself

A match for the sword.


My words got the slammer

When, as partners in crime

Ignored rules of grammar

And reasons for rhyme.


But what now of me?

A writer no less!

Vocabularyfree

Without means to express?


I beg them, “Come back!”

I pray them, “Release me!”

But the pen’s bruised blueblack



Quirky, strangely handsome loner with selfalienating
patterns finds himself an optimistic blonde


She'll be gorgeous
Like the bookstore catwalk of people affecting clever,
smart, worldly, frugal –
But with a slightly painful history


Optimistic blonde will break through the insect carapace of peculiar Me
All of it on an adventure –
Maybe a road trip
With mishaps and awkwardness


His hair will be outofbed wild
Clothing configured as from a weird unrealized decade
Her hair will be perfect
Her tank top pristine


Gonna make Me happy –
Go swimming
Fuck in the laundromat
Eat cactus
Feed a random homeless some cactus also


And she says


There's like, you know, so much
desert to farm cactus
and everybody could eat
You know
But cactus just has this bad reputation
because some careless guy got pricked


Right, so, they'll be farming cactus as the credits roll


But the walls close in on aliens
And quirky blondes don't have to work so hard
Not fit and pretty, Himmler created Aryan blondes
With that one mole on the right ass cheek


Aliens, their eyes become more strained
Piercing
Black
Carapace thicker and coarse with filaments
Growing fond of insect analogies


Until they just rattle around
Apartment bound
InBound InHome call center job
Internet screen names like KillEverythingNOW
Because quirky loner
it ferments into kerosene
Spark of brilliance into silent, nophilosophy monk on fire



If the world turned 'round

For a second glance;

If the sun touched the ground

To be near;

If the moon in the sky came down from on high,

Ashamed that her light was outshone;

If the Fates stopped spinning,

The birds stopped singing,

The wind stopped blowing

To watch the scene;

If plastic beauty's face's turned green;

If the old men grinned

And the young men stared

And barefoot young girls wished

They were as fair;

If a tear rolled down a face of stone

And not a soul felt alone;

If all the stars and all their light

And every bright diamond and gold plated jewel

Converged at one point,

And the beauty of that was outmatched;

And if one young heart was filled with hope;

Other than an orchestra
of organs
pounding away, till
the end of our
days?

Our music of
dying, the
broken outoftune strings
unheard, left to
crescendo and
echo away in
the wasting void
we call
doesn’t belong to me anymore

the person that wrote those lines
of despair and shame and utter honesty
has long been gone

it’s almost as if he died from selfinflicted wounds
from too much booze and tabacco
and whoring around
from not giving a shit about work
or baseball
or forgetting to buy chocolate and roses
on valentine’s day

reading page after page of the drivel
i want to tear them to pieces
but something inside me
won’t let it happen
because deep down i’m in love with the words
that used to bring me joy knowing my misery
was no different than yours




now, they insist, just move your tongue behind your teeth
but only to the silent do all the words become clear
It only takes a moment to learn what they can teach
meaning is just shyly hiding in places we can’t hear


in a soft caress flowing slowly down your skin
a coy affection as the racing heart begins
the pursing of the lips, the gentle leaning in,
the offer of a kiss and a little taste of sin


can you speak the smile that shines through a lonely glance?
or hear the heart that’s losing beats whenever you’re around?
wait with me a moment to give the silence a chance
Just an inch behind my back listening to my breathing
And if I turned around I’d be staring into your eyes
Saying that it’s okay, there’s no reason you should cry
Because I’m always by your side, and you’re always in my mind
You wont be forgotten so easily even though I’ve tried
To let you loose to let you go
But the thought has taken hold
Like liquid to a mold; we fit hand in hand
So now I try to understand when I lay in my bed
Why you’re not there but stuck in my head
With all these cruel thoughts that I wish that I’d forgot
But they’re just the extra baggage that come with you
On a rope held nice and taught
And only you can cut the line
When I see you
The next time I look into those green eyes
And I tell you how I feel
How I think of you every night
Laying by my side

That’s when I’ll move on
That’s when you’ll be gone

Everyone was insane, and the shoppers did roar

The displays were ransacked and sales out of stock

Cashiers were praying to be bashed by a rock

The dairy crew hid in their coolers in fear

While visions of eggnog made them shed a lone tear

And meat in their coats, and deli in their caps,

Had just revved up for a week of time and half

When out on the floor there arose such a clatter,

Management left the back to see what was the matter.

Away from my smoke break, I flew like a flash

Walked out on the floor and dealt with the backlash.

The fluorescent lights shined down on the insane;

I wanted to scream something vile and profane.

When what to my wondering eyes should appear,

But a train full of carts and eight cases of beer,

With a little old driver, so slow and so drunk,

My day would be ruined, my heart would be sunk.

His questions all sought me like moths to a flame,

He whistled and shouted and called me “shitstain.”

“Now bastard, now faggot, fudgepacker and queer!

Show me the baking soda; were you raised by a steer?!

To the top of the case! To the back of the freezer!

Get me this! I want that! Oh, just give me a teaser!”

As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,

His demands became crazy: the chicken must fry.

So up to the backroom the employees, they flew,

As they read his demands, they sighed, “I need a brew!”

And then in a twinkling, I heard over the comm,

“SALE ON CHRISTMAS HAM! THIS DEAL IS THE BOMB!”

As I drew in my head and was turning around,

‘Cross the store the nuts came with a leap and a bound.

They were all dressed like shit, from their head to their shoe,

Clothes crusted completely with mustard and spew.

A bundle of deals they had flung in their carts,

Eyes crazy and wild, breath smelling of farts.

Their eyes looked so dead! Their spirits wore thin!

They fought like wild dogs as they dug through the bin!

Bakery put out cakes draped with ribbon and bow,

But those soon became trampled like the freshfallen snow.

The CSM watched and then sobbed from the front,

As the store was destroyed by a cruel, little runt.

He had a broad face and a little round belly

That shook when he laughed like a bowlful of jelly.

He was chubby and plump, a mean little child,

And he laughed when we saw all that he had defiled.

A twitch in my eye, a pounding in my head,

Stupid liberal laws, he had nothing to dread!

He spoke not a word but went straight to his work.

Destroying the store, the devilish little jerk.

And laying his finger aside of my nose,

I just couldn’t wait, for the store would soon close.

He sprang to his mother as she paid for her food,

I wanted to yell, “MIND YOUR KID! SO DAMN RUDE!”

When his mom turned away, I leaned over his meal,


I just want you to know I'm writing this for you.
You don't know who you are but I do.
Maybe I'm just drunk I'm always drunk now.
There's nothing I can do. It's all a blur.
Living from one day to another.
I really hope the best for you and all of our friends.
I'll take another drink, I hope it's the last.
I just wish it was like it was back then. I wish I could live in the past.

no siren beckons me to you
no piercing voice or naked shoulder needed
my lips moisten for your swell.

Warmth in my throat,
my sheets lie cold
the bottom of my glass takes no breath.
Each waxy sip, it's own St. Peter
binding or loosening a cord around me.

The dim greenish bulbs of the bar
paint the otherwise unnoticeable waitress
as she wipes the empty stool beside mine.
Her breasts bounce in time with a
tired, morose country hymn.

No desire in my heart,
hardly a pulse in my too loose jeans.
I look to the bartender, his eyes fixed
On flesh eager to flee from the fusty blouse.
“Pour. She's not leaving and neither am I.”

Ulysses chased the song to know a woman

out a rainbattered window,

sky grey,

clouds low

and wondered where the rain ends?

a cease in the downpour is

not just a when

but a where too.

it is true that

somewhere in the drenched city

is an avenue,

one side wet,

the other dry.


in which I find myself
wishing to don a
lab coat and dissect

dead
things

disregarding my
complete lack of
training and the

inevitable
mess

but I’ve lost my appetite
for compound words.
The grammar nazis will
be satisfied, but semantic
nazis (not to be confused
with antisemitic nazis)
Will point out that brunch
is a portmanteau.


And that, is why I have no
stomach for breakfast,
Go something like this:
Each line stratified
Like so.
So as to add unneeded drama
to very specific,
and unrelatable thoughts

Now
A blank line. Between paragraphs.
Again
to add to effect.

The full context of an emotion
is often left unexplored,
Leaving most of us wondering
""what is this poet trying to
express?""

People are either very
vague.
Or try to express too many
Ideas in a single poem

A tip.
Keep it simple.
Be clever in the way you express a thought.
Make sure your reader can fully relate to this idea in any

One more thing
Make sure the title is obviously related to the content of the poem.
Don't try to be clever or cryptic with it.
That annoys a lot of people

I've never written a letter
and the ink may have bled
as my tears misbehaved,
but not even the rain
can wash away what I screamed

The efficiency of apathy clears the path to seclusion

Inhaling the ashes of bridges behind,

Stained, a muted martyr

Whose tears flow dry

Wide eyed wonder dies.




Squint to see through the fog

One stray step to fall

One false step to be lost

Is it the brave who travel alone?

but does he know to be fragile
with your glass bones
and porcelain skin
like i do?
does he know about your
apathetic words
and to trust the look in your eyes
more than the syllables from your lips
anyone can proclaim their love
just because they may be infatuated
by your beauty
but no one can understand the pattern
at which you think
and love you


My friend did say this:


Any more, black shoe

In which I have lived like a foot

For thirty years, poor and white,

Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.

.

Daddy, I have had to kill you.

You died before I had time

Marbleheavy, a bag full of God,

Ghastly statue with one gray toe

Big as a Frisco seal

.

And a head in the freakish Atlantic

Where it pours bean green over blue

In the waters off beautiful Nauset.

I used to pray to recover you.

Ach, du.

.

In the German tongue, in the Polish town

Scraped flat by the roller

Of wars, wars, wars.

But the name of the town is common.

My Polack friend

.

Says there are a dozen or two.

So I never could tell where you

Put your foot, your root,

I never could talk to you.

The tongue stuck in my jaw.

.

It stuck in a barb wire snare.

Ich, ich, ich, ich,

I could hardly speak.

I thought every German was you.

And the language obscene

.

An engine, an engine

Chuffing me off like a Jew.

A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.

I began to talk like a Jew.

I think I may well be a Jew.

.

The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna

Are not very pure or true.

With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck

And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack

I may be a bit of a Jew.

.

I have always been scared of you,

With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.

And your neat mustache

And your Aryan eye, bright blue.

Panzerman, panzerman, O You

.

Not God but a swastika

So black no sky could squeak through.

Every woman adores a Fascist,

The boot in the face, the brute

Brute heart of a brute like you.

.

You stand at the blackboard, daddy,

In the picture I have of you,

A cleft in your chin instead of your foot

But no less a devil for that, no not

Any less the black man who

.

Bit my pretty red heart in two.

I was ten when they buried you.

At twenty I tried to die

And get back, back, back to you.

I thought even the bones would do.

.

But they pulled me out of the sack,

And they stuck me together with glue.

And then I knew what to do.

I made a model of you,

A man in black with a Meinkampf look

.

And a love of the rack and the screw.

And I said I do, I do.

So daddy, I'm finally through.

The black telephone's off at the root,

The voices just can't worm through.

.

If I've killed one man, I've killed two

The vampire who said he was you

And drank my blood for a year,

Seven years, if you want to know.

Daddy, you can lie back now.

.


There's a stake in your fat black heart

And the villagers never liked you.

They are dancing and stamping on you.

They always knew it was you.

Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I'm through.





some really shitty coffee house where they

have really shitty poetry readings from aborted mothers

with dreadlocks that are obsessed with horoscopes and

where the donuts are always stale but everyone eats

them anyway just to do something because you

cant smoke inside and

where there’s a creepy man sitting at the table

close to the bathroom who secretly

(but not so secretly)

sells meth to anyone willing enough to buy and

where two kids fell in love and wasted all their time

at this really shitty coffee house that was so

special to them even though you

cant smoke inside and

no one can understand exactly why

but them and

they lived their lives always thinking it was some

really shitty indie movie from some

really shitty director who had only previously made

Though it is truer
Than everything else

My glass is here beside me
Empty now
The band plays
The singer sings
And the dancers dance
Only for me.

A poem is not love
And my love is not a poem

Nor is a poem the cure.

No.

It is only a bandage,

[What Would It Be Like To Fade Away]

What would it be like to fade away?

Like sand stained dark in a tidal bay.

A footprint leaves its mark and name.

Like those scratched onto a lonesome grave.

Forgotten, for it is dried the next day.

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like when love is gone?

When life has been lived for far to long.

When you cant remember a name or face.

But try with the hope to retain your grace.

Cause you survived, and they rest in lawns.

What would it be like when love is gone?


What would it be like to fade away?

Not be here tomorrow to see another day.

Nor feel the suns comforting embrace.

Like warm tears upon your face.

The wait is dark and I’m afraid.

What would it be like to fade away?


What would it be like to say goodbye?

Knowing it might be for the last time.

Tomorrow will be remembered for when I died.

Not leaving anything dear behind

I leave childless and without a bride.

What would it be like to say goodbye?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the toll of bells when there is no more sway

Silent and unheard with no more strain

The hammer won’t strike to cause them pain

They are at easy if only for an hour or day

What would it be like to fade away?

What would it be like without this weight?

Could it be my whole life would dilate?

I feel as though I don’t have the traits

To be among those who pass the cut rate

How many times do I need to reiterate

What would it be like with out this weight?


What would it be like to fade away?

Like the beauty of a dying bouquet.

Not like the bells whom endure their pain.

It cannot be washed away with rain.

I once tried to say goodbye

It came at the end of a string tie

There is no name that bares my lace

When time runs out ill loose all face

My crime was life, I feel as a slave

No one tends to the lonesome grave

Unlike the footprint gone the next day

Do I need permission so that I may

Find out what it is like to fade away.

The flies that mimic our dance

and visit through the porthole that brings us September

Eighty million times the same image,

divorced from the brutish coherence

that turns the tango into an accident

on a parquet floor.

We’re a shaky weeklong waltz tapped out on cobblestone.



the leaves flash their colors;
then let go
and as they tumble towards the ground
they are not sad
because They know that They'll be back
Greener than before



Much obliged, pardners.

the plums
that were in
the icebox

and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast

Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet

A fighter like Hemingway.

A lover like Ghandi.

You know Poe wrote somewhere dark.
Maybe Saint Peter wrote in the light.
Martin Luther King Jr. behind bars and
Shakespeare into the night.

So I'll swear like the Devil in a chair there next to me.
The Devil of hell where the soul of the sinner dwells.
So the Devil writes by the lights of the fire that burn him again and again.
""I'm sorry. I'm sorry and I will never damn humanity like I did back then.""
What has the Devil got to lose?

My pen spits words out and I haven't asked it why, but if you ask me?
My pen has a crush on paper and would give black blood just to give it meaning.
A place for the soul with words to throw but no ears to catch them.

""I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And I will never damn humanity like I did back then.""
And gave up on you, almost,
But it was closer than you know.

I tore myself with lies
Picasso portraits with moving eyes
Wondering if we'd died

And as the silence said nothing
I heard volumes, and something
Meaningless became consuming.

It ate into me day by day
And under stress I slowly frayed
As strand by strand I wore away.

And though I expected the rope to break
And let me fall to my deserved fate,
I took my post, and kept the wait.

I won't deny that I lost hope
And gave up on you  almost:
But we're still here to show
quivering and filthy from atmospheric dust
and he was crying because his wings were stripped
of their feathers by the free fall
and he had black hair and broad hands and he knew he
was beautiful naked
and he was too sad to show off his good looks because
he had two featherless stumps on his back
and I told him you’re not going anywhere
anytime soon
and we’re the only people on this island
so you have no where to go
and so he realized that even angels can be trapped
so he said he would stay with me
and so we swam in the surf on mornings when the sky
was the same color as the cliffs
and so cold was the water in which we swam
so salty was the water in which we swam
and so rough was the water in which we swam
when it scraped our legs with silt
and in the evenings storms passed
over the cliffs
and rain would have drilled holes in the roofs of
other houses. but not our roof because it is strong
and reinforced with heartstrings woven into fabric
like a tarpaulin that can only ever be made by two desperates
and it was during these evenings when I corrupted the angel
with gooseberry wine and bread ground from barley
and I forced him to dance the zeybek while I laughed
feeling the bowl of the baglama filling the void in my pelvis
and I forced him to drink the entire jug of gooseberry wine
while singing backwards prayers
and afterwards we made love on the bed he fell into
so many years ago
and as I thrust in and out, I grabbed the stumps
where his wings used to be
and he came to a climax
as I sucked his stumps
and he cried because he knew that someday
his wings would grow back
and he would never
feel that again
and I would never
With your loveliness, you fill all my needs.
After we're through, I'll never be the same.
You're beautiful to me, flower from seeds,
Of the heavens above, never leave me.
I doubt I'd live, were you not here oh love.
With you, in total darkness, I can see.
When I am with you, I cant get enough.
You cater to all my needs and wants, joy.
On valentines day, I will be with you.
My love for you makes me seem a young boy.
Since you love me back, it makes me feel new.
My love for you, like a train never stops.
How I love you, Call of duty Black Ops.

Front and center this fourth of July

Deny deny the fourth of July

Terror and treachery reign from on high

Authority and security turn a blind eye

To freedom and justice this fourth of July

Comply comply the fourth of July

All too soon will be the war cry

Liberty and Privacy say goodbye

Regretfully yours,

for your heart.


Silently it pleads
for past memories
of tangled tongues and
sun soaked sheets.


I am going crazy down here
missing you.


I have bloodied the tree trunks
of my fists
against my chest
shouting your name,
watching your silhouette dance
across the bedroom curtains
framed against the night sky,
stretched like a canvas
held by The Handless.


Your light is always on
and I know you’re never alone.


I miss your light.
I miss your touch.
I miss being wrapped in blankets
of your words.


Kiss me one last time,
won’t you
please?


Until then,
I will climb your balcony.
I will throw pinecones at your windows.
I will keep calling and calling and calling.
I will serenade you
like the madman I am,
like the madman you created,


because I don’t know
what else to do.


But, God,
your eyes are worth
a thousand lifetimes
of longing.



2:30 in the morning, she appeared in my sight



I knew in an instant that I liked her coy smile



Such a feeling I hadn’t felt in quite a while!

We exchanged correspondence in the weeks to come



I became infatuated; or as they say: “Struck dumb.”



The similarities we have are truly a myriad



We’d even read the same books: Eragon, Game of Thrones, and the Iliad.

I had to see her, come hell or high water,



I couldn’t dawdle, dither, or dodder.



So I flew like the wind towards NC’s coast,



And of that weekend, we made the most.

There was a moment when I had a big fright



My only recourse was to be totally contrite.



I thought I had ruined it, I had a big scare,



When I kissed her lips gently, then spit gum in her hair.

He wrote a poem

And he called it ""chops""

Because that was the name of his dog

And thats what it was all about

His teacher gave him an A

And a gold star

And his mother hung it on the kitchen door

And read it to his aunts.

That was the year Father Tracy

Took all the kids to the zoo

And he let them sing on the bus

And his little sister was born

With tiny nails and no hair

And his mother and father kissed a lot

And the girl around the corner sent him a

Valentine signed with a row of X's

And he had to ask his father what the X's meant

And his father always tucked him in bed at night

And was always there to do it

Once on a piece of white paper with blue lines

He wrote a poem

He called it ""Autumn""

Because that was the name of the season

And that's what it was all about

And his teacher gave him an A

And asked him to write more clearly

And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door

Because of the new paint

And the kids told him

That Father Tracy smoked cigars

And left butts on the pews

And sometime they would burn holes

That was the year his sister got glasses

With thick lenses and black frames

And the girl around the corner laughed

When he asked her to go see Santa Claus

And the kids told him why

His mother and father kissed a lot

And his father never tucked him in bed at night

And his father got mad

When he cried for him to do it

Once on a paper torn from his notebook

He wrote a poem

And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""

Because that was the question about his girl

And thats what it was all about

And his professor gave him an A

And a strange steady look

And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door

Because he never showed her

That was the year Father Tracy died

And he forgot how the end

Of the Apostles's Creed went

And he caught his sister

Making out on the back porch

And his mother and father never kissed

Or even talked

And the girl around the corner

Wore too much make up

That made him cough when he kissed her

But he kissed her anyway

Because it was the thing to do

And at 3 am he tucked himself into bed

His father snoring soundly


That's why on the back of a brown paper bag

He tried another poem

And he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""

Because that's what it was really all about

And he gave himself an A

And a slash on each damned wrist

And he hung it on the bathroom door

Because this time he didn’t think

He could reach the kitchen

On lower limbs which nat'rally make men stare

Although they preen their makeup, nails, and hair,

It's assets in their genes that carry clout.



To lure a mate they could just look and pout

And juicy lips put tension in the air

But turn and and shake an ample derriere;

Observing gents will feel no sense of doubt.


So look around you as the weather warms


To simply see the perfect female form,

The world goes round their rounds we feel it whirl;

Each pair of pants reveals those assets great,


Or we could do it every week just for fun to see what everybody comes up with.

I wonder if they realize she's unemployed,
fired not long ago from By The Slice
for kneading the same pie for three hours.


I pay her share, of course
to save her from eviction and so
she can continue using the gym equipment.


Often the neighbors complain
of finding their laundry littered with fur. I'll admit
she takes full advantage of the facilities,
the business center for her graphic design hobby
and booking the conference room for presentations
on the decline of migratory bird populations.


The tennis court goes without saying,
Springing from ancient, deep waters.
Far too still and calm to be trusted,
Too entrancing to not explore.
As I fell into you, splashing
I wished that I were
a better swimmer.
Not a graceless,
of dawn and crows
as if he owns the farm and every hen.
It is difficult to see his dwarfed head
from lack of comb and wattle,
and it is an especially chilly morning,
though the ruffled girth is apparent.
The freshest sunbeams highlight
his elongated feathers, tail and saddle,
as he waltzes about the yard,
reaching downward in further display.
And though the females scatter
as he approaches, surely it is respect
for his flavorful tender,
more precious than the ordinary cock,
that my current method
of evaluating my level of intimacy with a person
is by deciding
whether or not I can hear their voice in my head
when I read their text messages.
no lovers
no religion

pretty symbols fall like leaves
a pile of anchors
in a junkyard
where we're what we were.
Who's whose past?
Who doesn't forget.
Some? How?

From silently screaming.

I can't find a tear

But know somewhere
They're streaming.

I keep throwing rocks

But the water won't ripple.

Which way is up?

How can I know,

If gravity's fickle?

I recognize brilliance

But never create it.

Something has happened

And now I'm sedated

Like I'm drowning

In water that's only luke warm.

I don't know my skin

From the sea.

Or calm

From the storm.

I'm lost in the grey.

I long for definition.

I'm an artist

Who envies


Side glances

not the time of the knight, because I could be no squire,
or the time of the ship as I could not be a sailor
if the train would come, I could not conduct it,
but perhaps ride until the coal runs out.

But I cannot be a mere rider,
and I cannot be a leader because there is no leader in me.
Nor could I be the train on which the freight runs,
because my back can bear no weight at all except the weight of dreams.

That is what I am a perpetual dreamer.
But dreamers die sleeping. Though cozy and warm,
they will not ever seize the world,

(ps: he is in prison (in tx), and is also a writer.)


Time

Time is an essence, subject to the mind

Relative to all, both mortal and divine

Measured in sands or hands on a clock

It’s a burden and a blessing that Time never stops

These sands of Time, we’re subject to

Have no love or hate, for me or you

Time wears us down, until we break

And when we’re broken, our lives it takes

Merciless, it steals our looks and our youth

We can’t deny it, this harsher truth

Allah or Ra, they’re one and the same

We all call him God, but Time’s his real name

Time may heal our wounds, and keeps us alive

But in the end it decides to end our lives

Time affects the skies and deserts alike

Wastes away mountains, takes away the sun’s light

A blessing or curse, this thing we call Time

It tears us down in body and mind

Whether we’re here by mistake or here by design

We don’t answer to God, we answer to Time.


I wasted too many hours
Of my life
Not coming

On the wall

Where your face ought to be

So that when I feel empty

All I see

Is that the world is

Just one gaping wound

With 11,000,000

Cubic miles

of salt

Rubbed into it

He left me fineries and a name, untameable curls and a limp,
But did not think to give what made him great—
His poet's tongue and his lover's heart.

My father was a great lover, by all accounts;
He spread his love as freely as his seed
And gave up its fruits with cold abandon.

I had no more a place in his heart than a place at his side.
I was not his glorious boy, or a natural son worth writing to,
Merely a sickly girl with his devils in my blood.

My mother carved arithmetic into my skull as an exorcism
Until every creak of the floorboards beneath the carpet
And every gust of wind through the branches became a whisper of numbers,
A simple equation that never added up.

He did not leave me his heart,
But instead his ghost settled in mine.

My father's vanities sharpened my coarse tongue, made it a weapon.
They could slip rings on my fingers and call me a lady,
But I would never be so proud as when I heard the whispers
Of how my wicked mouth had the same curve as his.

I had no place in his heart but a place by his deathbed is enough.
We will lie side by side in the soil beneath the bells,
Counting the tolls to thirtysix; a number I shall share with him
Like a fatherdaughter inside joke, twentyseven years in the waiting.
pepperoni, olives, cheese

With smoke and fire and glass

Laying in bed hoping

That somehow you would pass

Through my mind like a train headed nowhere

With no riders to speak of

With a destination no one's heard of

from a platform packed with flatfaced nobodys

But, oh well

That's not the case

I'll pass on through these days

Glaze eyed and hazy headed

With a soft smile on my face

And you

Just outside of mind

when I fall, I fall hard

face flat on the concrete

in a display of failure

only few could appreciate

&amp;nbsp;

I always know when it’s coming

by the feeling in the pit of my stomach

and the echoes in the darkest corners of my brain.

my movement forward is fleeting,

in the scope of time and space,

but to me, it seems everlasting.

I long for the comfort of stillness,

even if the impact crushes

and destroys my soul. I will cry out from the pain,

and I will be heard, and I will not reach out

in hopes of being caught. I will race toward the earth,

however slowly, face first,

in acceptance of my fate.

See, I was made this way. I was built to collapse.

I was designed without the internal structure

necessary to keep myself erect, and I will implode,

time and time again, just to prove my imperfection.

&amp;nbsp;

I will rebuild

myself from the insides out, time

and time again, and I will wait,


Ocean of Dreams,

And Death has laid me now


The last free creature I will ever

Attempt to coax to my arms.

Other, more timid bells


a new word

more elegant than pussy

more intelligent than cunt

more heroic than beaver

more darkly for the hunt.

I am not a politician and shit does not come out of my mouth,

pussy goes in and around, above and below my mouth

and I want the best word for it to come out of my mouth

Her Jade Gate, Bermuda Strange

Sappy Pulp Tease

Queen of the Blasting Umbrella,

her other mouth never stops speaking to me.







A brilliant professor, smarter than most,
Made great inventions both small and grandiose!

Everyone loved him, for his creations that is,
For none ever hugged him or gave him a kiss.

The reason for that is simple but cruel,
He was a hunchback, with a face like a mule.

""I will make a wife of my own!"" He said to himself,
Grabbing his instruments off his top shelve.

Brains, eyeballs, organs and skin,
With cute red cheeks and a dimple in her chin.

After he put all the important ingredients in,
He filled her with slime and said ""done!"" with a grin.

With a strike of lightening he brought her to life,
He watched her, smiling, his beautiful wife.

She sat up with jolt and looked at him,
Then her pretty little face turned awfully grim.

""I'm too young and pretty to be married to you"",
She walked out the door and waved: ""Toodaloo""

With a sigh the professor grabbed the bucket of slime,
I would paint you a portrait so pretty
that the heavens themselves would blush redjealous.

or an author:
I'd write you a novel so perfect, so honest
that you and millenia of philosophers, too,
would rethink your existence.

and if I were a musician
I would take apart and piece together every single sound you'd ever heard
every shout of joy and every song of every bird
into a symphony so complete that it might even
capture me.

or, if God had made me as a poet instead,
I would write you a new poem each day,
each one better than the last, and you would fall
in love with meyou would fall deeper
and deeper
in love with me
with each
and every
word.

but I am as I am: a romantic without talent
in a world where only talented romantics are rewarded, hoping
not to be discovered by the masses, but only
to be recognized
by you.
as good sense tried to pull my phone
away from me.
the scene of that day almost
forming around me again.
it was my birthday,
and you agreed to see me
even though everyone
told you not to.

you made my day.

and you smiling with that flower
in your hair,
it almost does the same
to this day.

an angelic aura is there...

but then i force myself
to remember
about the birthday to come
and that there are no angels.

i lock my phone,
and quietly beat myself up
in the corner.
For his innocence he slew to feed his curiosity.

He is the cartographer of Hell; the emissary of Heaven.
At home in all the worlds but his own.
Friend of the gods, enemy of Man;

For where Man fears to look,
He looks.
What Man fears to question,
He questions.
What Man fears to doubt,
He doubts.

And so they fear him
As well they should;
For they know what dangers The Philosopher hath wrought in the past;
Know what the Shards of Eternity,
Dredged from the Abyss,
Can do in the hands of Man.

More beast, and more machine.
More demonic, and more divine.
More reasoned, and more insane.
He is the Homo Sapiens.

Then upon our parting, imparting

He said forgiveness is a powerful drug
It is addictive as well

Convenient advice for a thief of the flesh
But I gave him pardon all the same
To resent is to carry a burden

You looked so beautiful as you
Showed me scraps of paper,
Halfdrawn doodles on the backs of receipts
Just as precious to you
As photographs, torn
At the corners, wellworn
By your fingers.
Something tugs at your lips
As you feel the contour of every tear,
Nestling your needle into the groove
And playing them back to crackled life,


But only for you.
You're dancing now
To the rhythm of the boy
Who truly swept you from your feet,
And you don't notice
As I try to peek
At the records still sleeved,
Searching, hoping
For a trace of me.

1. Is the first line interesting and immediate?
2. Is the poem confused or obscure in some places?
3. Does the poem contain unnecessary words, phrases, details?
4. Are the line breaks used effectively?
5. Is the poem in the most effective order?
8. Does the poem contain cliches that don't work in a new way?
9. Does it 'show' through crisp, fresh images?
11. Is its language  striking and fresh, or drab and routine?








She does not know how I wander

through friends, lovers and lives

How I've been a thousand different people

who all got tired of being

How every day  I see a landscape

refined and reflected

through new eyes

And how nothing, not even love

can ever stay up with the shifting

and shuffling, the upheaval and recession

and constant revolving of my thoughts


And the truth is, I hate it

And the truth is, I love you

So I do it

I do it 'til it hurts

'til I wonder if I can take any more



I push myself forward, push myself to do it, because maybe

Just maybe

It will save you

I do it

To keep you away from what I had to go through

She tells me that she believes in me

And

She tells me that I'll know when

Enough is enough

But she doesn't know me, doesn't know how far I'll go

She doesn't know my desperation

To make your life better

Better than my own

But I will die trying




When the World ends,




And the bombs have exploded,




And all is said and done,




Maybe there will be wildflowers.





“Do we have to kill each other?”




Asked the little boy to the old man.




“Yes,” he replied.




“But we’ll come back”




“Humans are resilient like that.”





An invasive species works its way




Through the cracks




And doesn’t stop until it has




Completely




No,




Insidiously,




Wresting, usurping, changing,




Made itself home.





Don’t we know where we’ve come from?




Isn’t that how it always works?




When will we ever realize that history




Is a record that winds down until there




Is nothing but static and pop until




Someone flips it over?





Maybe in the quiet of our own selfdestruction,




When nothing is left but embers and regret,




There will still be wildflowers,




And a new invasive species will slowly take hold.


the pattern of crashing sea,
how what was once love becomes pain
when dreams return you to me.

Surround me now, music!

Nightmare,
with its talons rested deep in memory,
scrapes out my heart, eats it.

Work calls,
and I answer,
it's time now for me to go.
If only I would quit and spend
my time more productively than filling shelves...
but work calls,
and I answer:
my hands are yours, Dominus
snap my pencil,
banish all expression:
I'll pick the broken stub out from the trash
and write its elegy
on the restroom wall.

Is £7 (or any amount) an hour worth
the blemish of my once golden desires,
the crucifixion of my stupid soul?
I ask but know the answer, it can only be 'No'...
but work calls,
and this coward answers,
so now it's time to go.

our eyes fucked
and loved and
sang to each
other


The angle of your hips
allude to a certain secrecy
unknown to the lips.

My mind falters
to measure the degree.
Would solve the oldest of mysteries,
divine providence or alchemy,
answered in your expression.

But all known and unknown
will never rival.
With words or gentle touch.
You could hold my breath's arrival


with burdened sins of cities soiled.

I find forgiven careless sins;

Nor stood I the very highest.
On sea, I can not be of assistance,
So where lies the right of my existence?

My neighbors radiate and twinkle
While I slowly age and swiftly wrinkle.
One day, hoping for some consternation,
I even got left out of my own constellation.

So, as to many people's comprehension,
I eventually let go of all the tension.
I slipped and fell, but was relieved,
consciously splaying out, fro
conspicuously rustling in, to
i stumble upon hunger

waves so shoally superposed
tensioned surface, and at nomore, shudders
yet attention to moressocial surfaces another
yellow sea sickness broods like no other

though you say you love me.
You speak up every time I think,
so I've learned not to think in words
because you're a clingy bitch.

Get out! Why won't you leave?
You're like a cockroach that
eats crumbs of bread in the corner
under dim lamplight, sulking
as your antennae feel around
for the next bite. I don't
want to smash you into brown paste
on the counter top.

I'd relocate you if I could,
put you outside where
a bird would gobble you up,
feasting on your squishy insides
because you're so loveydovey.

But no matter what, I hope you
at least fade away like a ship into fog.
Your voice haunts me
every day and I just want to
forget that I ever saw Pacman
on the wall, thought
there were impish basement
dwellers who I left
a toaster and English muffins for,
or believed I was famous,
constantly observed,
everything meaning everything,
with FBI agentnurse
""Anne Bradstreet"" as a guardian angel.

Make sure you take Robert Frost
with you, and I'll make sure the door
slams you on the way out.


The man in 7B likes to slice his thighs,
He hides the scars under suits in the lift,
Smiles as he nods his goodbyes,
At least the end will be swift.

The woman in 4K mourns her dead son,
Gunned down on the corner of Wilson Street,
The men surrounded him, he was dead, it was done,
She drowns herself in whiskey, the taste so sweet.

The daughter in 1C watches
Her parents as they fight,
Her mother’s blood hits the carpet in blotches
What can she do? Just cry all night.

The man in 11D is me,
Desperately trying to finish his novel,
But he knows it will never be enough
To free him from this hovel.

There’s a pregnant girl in flat 12E,
She’s a slut they say, it’s been casually decreed,
You may say she’s doomed, but I disagree,

Sounded better in my head



Taking Flight

For Erica Belius

i.

6am cicadas croon on your windowsill
and two heads of hair knot on your pillow.

There’s something wrong with the shadow
on the bed: morning light bends
toward you from the steel in his hand.
You’re not sure if he’s grabbing
back your hair or hers—

Until she shrieks through teeth
that could be yours. Wings
burst out red onto the white sheets—

Your twin sister’s voice is a bell in your head.
You stumble for help, but she’s already ringing:
too late, too late.

ii.

You wade through sunbroken grass
in velvet, holding your mother’s hand.

Flies in black mourning clothes
circle above your house
calling Gloria, Gloria.

They welcome your sister. Buzzed, they sing.

Child, six years old, you don’t know this yet
of angels: even the cicada must leave
its body behind to fly away.

In memory of Lauren Belius September 16, 2004 – July 19, 2011




So, a big congratulations to Superciliary!



Notes on the judging (for those who are interested)



I hit on her with similes, ""You're like the full moon's glow!""

""You are to beauty as sun to light"" my analogies filled her head

My English prowess must have worked, she woke up in my bed

""Beauty is in the eye of the beerholder"": an idiom I've heard before

…the last sip of tea
with all the sugar in.

Maybe that’s why
we were so shortlived;

I drank too greedily, so
now you’re gone and
i’ve only myself to blame
for not taking it slow
and savouring the taste.

But in my defence:

your sad eyes were the first sentence in a perfect novel,
they hooked and drew me in, urged me to read on, so i did.
Your character was my favourite piece in a poetry book,
pure beauty hidden beneath a mountain of cold text.

I don’t wear my red chequered shirt anymore,
except on the days I wake from a dream of you in it,
and like a lonely child in love with their comfort blanket,
I put it on and feel close to you again.

Maybe you were poison after all,
maybe that’s why I’m still lovesick;

an addict,
hungry for another fix

of the ecstasy on your lips,
the euphoria secreted from your hands into mine
when you’re nervous of this…

this…love?
Or any emotion at all?
I’m not sure.

Folding and unfolding a brief moment so many times
the photograph has become warped and
I don’t know what it looked like in the first place

Our most recent meeting was a melancholy affair
Filled with laughter and knowing silence
I looked across the table at a young woman
I never actually understood

Two dots on a map that only ever knew distance
Growing separately, independently until
tattered memory was all that remained
but it’s going to be okay.

See, I went for a walk last night and
Loved every minute of it.
The moon off set the bracing cold
With an alluring grace

I only thought of you twice:
Once when two people laughed distantly
And again when the noise settled.
I hoped that you were happy wherever you were

We all have dreams that never see any light
That's one of those hard facts of life
And I am whiteknuckled, like a vice grip that's
learning how to let go. Slowly, slowly.

You know as well as I do that
Time unfolds exactly the way it means to
And so too goes this prayer for acceptance:

those big brown eyes,

that chiseled jaw

makes girls sigh.

It can't be true,

he looks too shy.

A boy like him

wouldn't hurt a fly.

He's just nineteen

could be a model son

It's such a shame

About the marathon

He killed six people

a child of eight

looks aren't everything


When I lie below the earth

No poppies bright, nor lilies white

They seem of little worth

For I lie not in a churchyard

Where flowers like to grow

I lay my head

On a humble bed

In the marsh,

Beneath the snow

By an old oak tree

In a hollow place

No one my soul to save

But by your grace

Sweet dreams I’ll chase

With a mushroom on my grave






“If I get better I’ll be like this. If I be like this I’ll get better.”
I don’t know which one comes first.





I fell asleep
with

Woodrow
Wilson

in my mouth





Earlier
that afternoon,
He saw me waiting
at the bus stop
on division,
and
he knew
i wasn't
waiting for a
second
chance.


He knew that i wasn't
waiting for morning.

And, he knew
that at

the sound of caged
animals i  would take
off running for
wisdom and
truth.


He knew that at

the sound of gun
shots
i
dropped
dimes
like lit cigarettes on
those swollen old

Children.



And when one shoe
fell off
the Halsted
bridge he knew
that

i wouldn't be going
down

after it.


He knew the
antinomy
of saints, is not
what kept me glued
to my seat.


It was the
notion that time
stopped
when i turned off
my eyes.


It was
when i found out
that his truth,

was filled with venom

that
I began to look
past the atrophy of
democracy.


And I fell asleep
in the midst
of buying groceries.


And his
Children will cry
forever,
waiting for me to
bring them candy
and plastic.


His Children,
will cry forever, with
their boiled
stomachs

hang
ing out
(At arms length)
Waiting for Legions
and equity



Waiting for

and billiard balls in
the

rooms

of catholicism.


Each one of
his Children

held their hand, as
they uploaded

But then i let go of

that those Children be

first sign of mitigating

It wasn't a dis
ease that

It was
the irony
i let go of.

It was
a landfill
that i fell in love with.



it was a tire iron, and
a mail box that sent

my wisdom through
dream states of ivory

It was his Child, i let

It was a

I spent close four and half



To the Sextagenarian on the 6 Train:


I realize you're not from our time, that ink is lowbrow in your mind,

but do I need to mention we're both modified?

Though I get to keep all my laugh lines.

So look again, puffy Pin, your face struggling to sneer,

My change marks celebration; Isn't yours born of fear?




Draft 1:

To the Sextagenarian on the 6 Train:

You're welcome to question my body art, if I get to question your botox.


saying we're both modified... Though I get to keep all my laugh lines.

So look again, puffy Pin, your face struggling to... sneer?

I changed my body in celebration;


and think of all that imagery

I didn't think of,



And yesterday I rode the bus

out of pure lonliness;

I rode into the city to look at the lights

And I took pictures of the lights that

were lonelier than I was.

I planned on telling anyone who asked

that I wasn't from around here

Which is sort of true. No one asked.

And when I realized the pictures

were just okay,

I thought maybe my poems were too.

And either way,

It's not my fault if they're good or bad, or just okay.


Some bums passed by me on the bridge, not knowing or caring.

And they had their bum lives and bags,

filled with whatever they were filled with.

It was a lot like the word  sonder

Which is a good word that's just overused, like saying something

has been beaten like a dead horse.

But not too long ago I told about it

to a girl I really like, and she seemed to like it.

We climbed up on to someone's garageroof and pretended it was ours,

we found ourselves wrapped
in thick, druidic silence.
And as the shisha smoke
swam 'round the naked bulb,
I felt a tremor pass
through the natural world,
as if every beast of the earth
cried at once in wordless angst
to the cold moon.

So as I sat, clutching my cold coffee
(like black dew from the valleys of hell)
and the Devil in the fire spat sparks,
I issued a terrified prayer
to whatever lunatic God there may be,
that he may spare my unshaven soul.

His heart had holes,

and the holes filled with doubt.

He thought of his life,

one he could do without.

His heart grew dry,

and began to split with cracks.

He lost himself;

could he never go back?

But his heart hurt too much;

he had to take control.

So he thought of the things

that made his heart whole.

Then he closed his eyes,

took a big leap of faith...

And ended up on the other side safe.

His heart opened up,

and he took off his shell,

and he said with a smile,

'I made it through hell.'

And he urged all the others

to take the same chance.

And some did, and they made it,

and they smiled and danced.

So happy was he,

to beat back his mask.

And so proud was he,

for it was no easy task.

So when you are ready,

just lower your guard,

and join us who have strength

Was the same as any day
I was drunk and out of smokes
And it rained in the town
That never stops raining
If I could've smiled, I would have
When I remembered I was late on rent again
It was the fifth of the month;


Amongst the darkest coral spires,

In murky, dank and rotting mires,

A world of fierce aquatic liars,

Of thieves, and cheats and law defiers,

A catfish shouts, a dogfish barks,

A beaten trout, by loanshark sharks,

A ratfish squeals, he tells, he blabs,

The slutfish gives the manfish crabs,

The underworld of undersea,

Where crime and brine entwine with glee,

Then find their minds combined and freed,

By hydroponickind seaweed,

The only schools you’ll find don’t teach,

They bully whales up onto beach,

A cruellest rule of a sorry sea,

Devoid of all authority,

Mermaid hookers deck the corn’,

They yawn and mourn the ocean dawn,

Against the backlit shops, adorned,

With porn and prawn, regret and scorn,

The octopi, with tendrils, clench,

A screaming, squirming octowench,

They ink her face with blackened stench,

Her grave; the Mariana Trench,

The Killer Whale is born to kill,

He spares no time for fucking krill,

He lusts for flesh before it’s stale,

He’s not some fucking softcunt whale,

He goes to where the tuna be,

And live and play and chew the reed,

He’ll seize the Orcatunity,

To feed his greed while tuna bleed,

Anemone play violent pimp,

To teenage, nearly naked shrimp,

While coward dolphins dive for air,

It seems they feel much safer there,

The land; it’s such a safer bet,

“We’ve sure evolved to walking yet?”

So sick of crime and fear and wet,

And porn and prawn and scorched regret,

A nurse shark slips prescription drugs,

To starving, mad, ecstatic bugs,

The stingray scrounge the silty depths,

Jacked up on coke and crystal meth,

A swimbysting, a family torn.

In Flounder's Field, a thousand morn,

But one each hour, a seafiend's born,

In coral spiked like devil's horn,

In this cruel world of fish and prawn,

And death and crime, and lust forlorn,

And hate and fear and dust and scorn,

""Do all to stay away!"" they warn,

From porn and prawn, regret and scorn,

And porn and prawn, regret and scorn.

The eve before Salvation's dawn,

Will reek of porn, but mostly prawn.

broken and bleeding in the failing light
cursed with a mind that wont stay still
its effortless to surrender, so come get your fill
brash and uncanny, i cant place the thought
the face burns in my brain, scorching red hot
a lot on your mind, let me take it away
washed out and colorless, the dawn of a new day





I hope someone finds this useful
to have a jaw line and collar bone,
to make the ladies fawn and moan,
all for me.

I heard bulimia is like Russian roulette,
but all I can muster is the guilt and regret.
Maybe through this coffee and cigarette
I can finally redeem myself.

Because if I was smaller
like a tiny creepy crawler
I'd be ignored,
or beautiful.
to pull your hands from his.

he is not your father—
he has stayed longer than your father ever would or did,
his smile is easier and more wicked,
a product of dents and beltlashes
from when a man held him down and etched
cruelty onto his soul.

he is not your father, just a silverware reflection
of your own inheritance, your father’s spark
in your bottlegreen eye saying:
“go on, then.”

it’s a spark that has almost killed you
more times than you can remember,
more than you can piece together
from recollections of almost arrests,
cellphone photographs that blur
the bruises on your hips.

i am not your lover
though there are lives where i must have been,
lives where i threaded my fingers through yours
and you believed me when i said you were worth saving.

but in so many more i am the girl
who holds your hair back as you vomit,
who drives you home as you babble in the backseat;
making apologies and curses and promises
that you are genetically predisposed to break.

he is not your father, and he is not your god,
even when he makes you small
and sinks his hands into your pockets.
he takes more than money, more than sex,
he makes you weak the way that you make me weak,
the way that i need you to be,
but wrapped around a different finger.

he is not your father,
though he will always let you down.
i am not your lover,
though i hang on every reckless word
and come running when you call for someone else

because there is a spark,
an undying glimmer in your eyes—
maybe a tear, or maybe not—
and i can see infinity reflected through the murky green,
your lips mouthing:
“maybe next time.”



Anyway, here they are.



On a day like any other….

On a day like any other,
they two wait like beetles
in the dark,
for the light,
so that scuttling, they can
seek the dark, to wait again.

She would welcome death  his!
And so would he.
Instead he milks her breast of scorn
and wants his pillow fluffed,
dark stained and damp
with ancient tears.

On a day like any other,
she bellows broad
the aching of their days,
charging strangers dear
with uttered pain for sympathy.

No friend in this small house,
none, not one to see
the apparatus of a dying man,
hid well in drawers
and capsuled dreams.

On a day like any other,
he lies unfinished,
a cankered doll, limp
and lost, discarded,
but for she who tears his ears
and pokes his eyes
seeking his mortality.

On a day like any other....



The Bird

A bird flew into my life with a thud
and died.

The window, though clear, was hard
unyielding, deadly.

At my desk with thoughts diffuse
it broke into my life
with its neck.

It fell on impact, tried to stand
and fell again, dazed then dead.

It was warm, soft and beautiful
and dead in a bloody pool.

I buried it under the bottlebrush.
When it flowers in spring
and the honey eaters come
to feed on the sweetness
of the flowers.
I will remember the death.
I know that I will.



'he said'

‘Tea?’ he said, red faced;
‘It’s just a cough.’, he added,
as he cleared his throat.
I asked him how he was,
‘Fine.’, he said.
He mentioned his father.
‘Died at my age.’, he said;
‘He never surrendered.’, he said.
‘Better man than I.’, he said.
‘We often live in shadows.’, I added.
He shifted and coughed.
‘Tea?’, he said, and coughed again.
‘Had a bit of trouble as a lad.’ He said.
‘Never got over it really.’
‘Coughed all my life.’, he said.
‘Never seems to work.’, he said.
‘My dad died sat in a chair.
Knew he was off, said his goodbyes,
and died sitting up.
That’s a lot of poetry I’ll never
write.
Those poems that
reference other poets.
The ones that readers
read and
think the poet is a good poet
because of the poets he
knows.
No one will think
while reading one of my poems,
“He referred to Pound’s dog, Peter!”


I think writers make up
poets
that do no exist,
to make it seem they’ve
scoured the literary ends of
the Earth
on a passionate quest
for those lost works
buried under Ages of ice,
boobytrapped in ancient tombs,
shipwrecked in Spanish Galleons,
forgotten in the  bathrooms of
coffee shops.


They come up with names like
Junga, Hansun, Chaucer,
the more European the better.
Then they type about
Junga’s boa constrictor,
Hansun’s hamster,
Chaucer’s chimpanzee
And they are all drunks too,
these imaginary poets,
drunks,
womanizers,
gamblers.


Has there ever been a boring poet,
not poems
there is a sea of that
but poets?
Are they all
bullfighters
or do street cleaners
write too?


I know a lot of

Writing poetry is no mean feat.

Clickityclack and a spacebar smack;

Empty sentences send you backkkkkk.

~

Sit by a tree, write with a pen.

Find inspiration, accomplish, and then,

Reread and revile your atrocious pursuit;

And crush, without mercy, its poisonous root.

~

Vow and declare, 'I'm a poet no more!

No longer shall I darken that cursed door.'

Now close the computer and go watch the birds!

(Attempt to describe them in less than twelve words).

I hold you up to my lips –

Click.

I feel the heat radiating from my fingers to my mouth.

I take a deep breath and let you in,

And for a brief moment – ecstasy.

My blood pounds and head buzzes.

Intoxicated by you,

I feel alive… full of energy.

Maybe this is what I was looking for all along?

As you course through my veins,

I can’t help but to start to notice

The happiness and ecstasy slowly becoming ashes.

Hanging on for dear life, they cling to the tip

Before a gentle breezes disperses them forever.

Like everything else, it decays gradually

Until it’s reached it’s expiration date.

As I grip onto what’s left,

I feel the heat radiating from my fingers to my mouth.

I take a deep breath and let you in,

But this time, it burns.

EDIT:  Rewrote some of it, adding a few lines and making some minor edits.

Like anything else, it starts with a spark

I hold you up to my lips –

Click.

Miniature fireworks erupt from my fingertips

And ignite you.


The heat radiating from my fingers to my mouth,

I take a deep breath to let you in.

And for a brief moment – I forget

About my all stresses and worries:

Meetings, due dates, bills,

The last time I fed my cat…


My blood pounds and head buzzes.

Intoxicated by you,

I feel afloat,

Lighter than the wisps of smoke swirling around my face.

Maybe this is what I was looking for all along?


As you course through my veins

I can’t help but to notice

Happiness and ecstasy slowly turning into ashes.

Hanging on for dear life, they cling to the tip

Before a gentle breezes disperses them forever –

All that you once were,

Replaced by awkward, empty space.


Like everything else, it decays gradually

Until it’s reached the expiration date.

I grip onto what’s left,

The heat radiating from my fingers to my mouth,

And take a deep breath to let you in,

Only this time, it burns.



There once was a Japanese hen

He wanted ten times of his yen

but he was so poor,

of course he wants more

But zero times ten is no yen!


The moment before you went away.

I know that nothing would make you stay,

But I wish I'd said them anyway.


Those three little words I wish I'd said

Are bouncing around inside my head.

I pray for a change of circumstance,

So these words may have a second chance.


I'll say them here, if, at all, it helps.


I can share a thousand thoughts and never even sing

I can live a thousand lives and take them all in vain

I can shed a thousand tears and never make a stain

I can walk a thousand steps and never reach an end

I can run a thousand paths and never find a bend

I can sleep a thousand years and still awake so weary

I can wait a thousand lifetimes and still you won't step near me

I can fight a thousand battles and realize, with no sting

You must begin,
To live your life by it’s very whim.
Embark on a journey,
Or rather a quest,
For which the prize is eternal rest.
Stay patient my friends,
Your days will quicken,
Your body will slumber, mortality stricken.
Try as you might,
The days won’t last,
But presently your future looks brighter than your past.

Washed it down with Water, slipped into my River bed,

My brain grew legs, decided it was done living in my head,


My brain stepped out, it saw beauty, and beasts, like Belle and Sebastian,

movies, and TV, talltell and action,


Lascivious activists that stopped fapping from a slap on the wrist,

and feminists retracting their battleflags, not pissed.

It's Gods fix, opiates, even for nosy kids that know there's no God, atheists.

And maybe this is the answer,

We all need to be prescribed a tiny bottle of go dancing,

Drive a car full throttle, Find a model to be romancing.

I never thought fully about the phrase live a little,

Until I did pills,

Now I'm filled with smiles, grins and giggles.
and in the brightness of her face,
and in her soft and simple grace,
I found a truly gorgeous space.

And there I basked in the sweet glow
of beauty I'd just come to know;
completely caught up in the flow
of new life bright as white is snow.

But, of me, she began to tire,
and soon our bond came to expire,
and so she left; my sole supplier
of lifetransforming, warming fire.

I try so hard now to erase
the memory of her embrace,
and image of her shining face,
and aura of her gentle grace.
I try so hard but can't efface;
I try so hard but can't displace,
not even one damned single trace
of how she filled that sacred space.

The world is dark without her light,
my brightest day has turned to night,
her memory's a constant plight;
a burden I've no strength to fight.
Now if that burden would ignite,
the fiery blaze would reach great height,
from brilliant flames, dark would take flight,
sunlight'd, at last, be cast so bright.

But it's no chance of catching fire,
no matter how much I desire,
A phoenix's rebirth won't transpire,
instead, that burden binds like wire.

Not one star shines, the moon is new,
and luminance my soul lacks too.
Moments of peace I have are few,
and my stay here is far from through.

Now I explore depths of my mind,
in hope that, someday, I will find
what continues in me to bind
to those that I must leave behind.
With weedstrewn fields,
Grass stained shirts,
In sunfilled days,

From light to dusk,
Hats wrung with sweat,
In rain or shine

As kids we grew.

On tailored diamonds,
With freshcut grass,
Under the lights,
The field was truth,

From first to ninth,
Wrists wrapped in tape,
Between the lines,

As kids we grew.

And as men as men  as men we wait…

In the stands for the first time,
You all alone between the lines,
One swing left you never missed,
Down one two outs three balls two strikes,

As kids we played

As kids we grew

As men we wait

So fight like hell and swing for life

For me and you.
Our bodies dumped in stormy seas
The price we pay for our disease
these madeup words are your oracle, screaming
at you from the pages of flimsy
romance novels and gossamer lips on
silver screens: this is how to be, this is how to be.



me—n., a woman in heels and lace,
headturning and plumed, a tropical bird
among pigeons, dripping with sex
so every man turns her way. she is
a star stunning and beloved, as
essential for life as the sun.



you covered yourself in prophecies, the words
heavy on your skeleton, pulling you into
the ground. this box you've built is your temple,
the words are your god. you're craving
a miracle (surely your piety
deserves reward), but faith won't
put out. you decide you must be more
devout, carving the words deeper
into your skin. you won't settle



Active woman.

Yoga, pilates, jogging, running.

Single but not alone.

Routined but not boring.

Something new. Someone new.

Friendly but mysterious.

Attractive but not perfect.

Routine broken.

Happiness.

Happiness?

Happiness...

New life. Mistake?

Mistake but no regrets.

Hers. His?

Engagement.

Fights.

Running with stroller.

Marriage.

Fights. Physical.

Running with stroller.

Tragedy. Accident. Accident?

Broken.

Prison.

Divorce.

Running.

Running with stroller.

Can't stop running.

Won't stop running.

Running with stroller.



Reddit, I present to you the Andreanic poem, this is what it is:






one
step
ahead of me.


Go at your own pace, that is what common advice tries to tell me
Everywhere I look,
I see people I want to be
places I want to be
ideas I want to be.
ocean and light
the rain
or patterns
on tin,
keeping you dry


A grey statue
Her skin breaths
From fresh chiseling
Her form is carved
From your stone


The birds o'erhead
Are the enemy
Defecating
On her effigy
Taunting her
With their freedom


Sisyphus, your gaze
Falls lustfully
The afterlove
Not reciprocated
The stone woman
Creaks as she sways


The stone takes
A slow tumble
The hill groans
'neath its weight
Thunder claps the sky
In twain

She trembles
Amid the sinews
Of her skirts
Sisyphus takes hold
And heaves


He hides
In his foxhole
She is no vixen
The trembling sky
Is terrifying
She feels nothing


Quit your task
In futility
The trees prefer you
The effigy
Will betray you
Her heart echoes


The myth nullifies
She is narcissus
The bonepool
Invites her
Your curse may

For the things it has seen

Two sides to every action

Translucent between


Would it remark about it’s vibrating pain

From loud music and screaming names

Or the force it is shut with when weather becomes cold


“My backside’s still freezing” it might say.



Sit beside me Lady and make me strong.
Your breath in my ear, the wind; your lips
on my cheek, the rain. And sailing in your
weather the way is as true and the ocean is blue
and farther shores are closer, closer every day.


Aren't they? I pray to you, Lady, stay with me
and be my strength. Make me leaden with your
weight and take the weight of my fears, will you?
And how swiftly, gently you will wash away, unmake
the deadening of the day, or so they say...


Stay, stay, my Lady, simply stay. See I'll take
to my knees for you, my legs are no good anyway.
Stay and slay the sun's crushing gaze and leave me not
to wake to aches and empty days of counting hours
until your cool hand handles mine again.


For you I'll do a thousand things undone, tomorrow.
If you'll just listen, listen! Songs, and sorrow:
Princess of the green glass, the oak cask.
Queen of fields of barely and of hops,

In lingering lights of stars,

And all I hear are my muted breath

And the rush of passing cars.

I wish I had a sweetheart

To greet me when I wake

And assure me that this dark, cold day

Is nothing I can't take.

I dream a sweet companion

Who hears my sighing say

And comforts me still sweetly

When I dread the coming day.

But nights are unforgiving;

Waking's a better bet.

Perhaps I'll find some patient friend

and all I do is climb.
I lust to span the atmosphere;
to seek him and to find.

I long to kiss the wispy lips
embrace the arms of cloud.
My shoes are worn; my eyes are strained,
yet I am just a mound.

The mountain knows a higher truth
I've never learned on earth.
The deluge; dark, dispensing walls;
illuminates my curse.

I'll search in texts and scrolls of men,
chase every phrase I find;
The mountain stands above the seas

Sniffing each other's rectums.

Such friendship, divine.

I once saw a snake in a tree,

I said to myself, ""How could that be?

He doesn't have any arms or legs, or a single claw,

So why didn't this snake fall?

Maybe it's not what you have to use,

anyone can succeed in whatever they choose""


""What do you mean?"" The snake said to me

""I was only following my dinner, you see.""


Then it hit me (not the snake),

It's not a choice we get to make.

We grasp and reach for the top,

Only because we die if we stop.

sexy girls booze and video games
who needed more  ?
but in my early 20s, after several game overs
failed love attempts
and plenty of drunken nights
puking into toilet bowls
i realized
that unlike the video games
you only get one chance at life
and i needed something more
so i put down my controller and picked up a book
studying the great minds of our time
Nietzsche Tolstoy and Hume
i meditated under the great bodhi tree and
found a god in everything till
everything ment nothing
and my body drifted effortlessly
apart threw this empty earth
but then one day
a falling out
a epiphany
a high heeled dynamo dressed in a red dress
smiled at me
i bought her a drink and we talked about video games
nintendo she still played
i bought her another drink
and we talked some more
it was in this fuzzy moment of drunken clarity that
i realized a cosmic truth
buddha may have had
love
nirvana
and infinite wisdom
but all i really needed was
sexy girls booze and video games.......


you’re right.

Right.


Left.

What if I left?

What would be left?

I should leave…right?




Here's a haiku to finish it off

The roots never grow

Though branches extend endless

and there is music filling the empty spaces
in the stagnant air i breathe and live
and i hear a yelp and i gasp
it is beautiful and lustrous and it fills me
it fills me and i overflow with a bounty
of blossoms and this is when i stop and take
i take it in and it blooms like violin strings
breathing into each other like i sometimes
breathe into your fair face and i long for you
for you to stop and take me in all of me
and i can no longer breathe as the music
bursts and burgeons throughout ourselves
breaking me apart breaking me in two
myself and you when i am alone there are two
you and myself shimmering radiant fallen angel
this music i hear this is it it is everything and
times like these make me think i am nothing
I cry as my hands type
My heart remembers
Your fruitless communication.

I took you as you were
You took me as I seemed
I taught you to open up
While I gave you mirrors.

Ivory keys cackle at me
Helping me strip personas
Shuddering as I become
As cruel as I was before.

We locked lips in the sunrise
Knowing it was to be goodbye
You hoped to never let go

Of paranoid paralysis
Irrational analysis
Not taking any calls.


My  Schizophrenic synthesis
Is placid's mad antithesis
And fucking hell on top of this
catch the weight
my heart pumps
stoic blood
into these hands
cold clamping steel
that write a history
that isn't now
but once was
a true account
of a young man
who buried thoughts
and burned his dreams








the bell tolled for us

Yet the ring clanged hollow

They told us we had won

But all we could see

Was the destruction we had done

The dust will clear

The hurt will return

We will remember

We broke it.
displays of life
a sauteed matinee;
a small soiree
where questions of death
entomb the summer day


spontaneous philosophy
fills the foyer
where faceless friends
contemplate beginning and end


and I, not knowing where
to lay my flowers down,
drop them on the floor
to be stepped on
like every time before


and in an epiphany
I exclaim
Thats Life!
but unanimously they disagree
and say to stop thinking
The wearisome day ending
I think of my life so far
the paths I've taken
the paths I've yet to take
the people I've met,and the people I've yet to meet.
But as the ink dries on the paper,I think of you.




Your blue eyes
your cherubic lips,
skin like ivory, and just as precious,
your aura of confidence,
though mixed with a vulnerable femininity,
drove me crazy,
made my head go hazy.
I could not think straight
with you on my mind.




Words cannot describe
the way I feel about you
but still I attempt.
My feelings are fathoms deeper than that
of the ocean blue,
Warmer than the surface of the sun itself
and truer, than any words
That man has ever spoken.

The way you make me feel
makes my heart beats faster
than any beat of a drum
you make me feel higher
than any bird can fly.




Let every word in this poem be like notes of music,
each one different, unique, but filling your soul,
let every verse be like a kiss,
though one I cannot give,
but setting your inner passions alight.




Till I see your face again,
Do not lose your beauty;
Those deep blue eyes,more beautiful than the vast sea
Its hue, unique to you.
nor your smile, shall it never age,
or your vibrance, do not allow it to dim




So here the long goodbye,
parting ways, in uncounted days.
I finish with a kiss that i cannot give,
forgive me for my mistakes,
I hope to leave only good memories,
Of affection, and good times we had
While I reminisce on what was lost,
and what was to be,
live your life full of bliss,
enjoy every moment,
a life blessed with fulfillment.
Washing in between my fingers
Thinking of graduation, and the
Feel of freedom when he’s not around
When the stall door
Clicked
And you
Sidled up next to me with your
Aloneness
You were wearing that hoodie
Fire Engine Red
Breathing in the tension of your last breath
And I dried my silken
Hands on bristled paper towels
As the water flippantly waxed
Off my skin
I almost asked
“Remember when you used to be normal?”
In the 4th grade we all played some soccer,
But I’ve flipped the pages and
The cartoon changes every time
Here you are: red hoodie, hair like
Posh spice
But awkward
You were thinking of soap and strangers
I’m sure of it
You were a pod split open
Grasping for today
Instead of tomorrow
and turn left occasionally.


I converse often
with myself and others.


I hold the receiver
a few inches from my mouth


stare into wide screens
for several hours


crossing and uncrossing
my legs.


I both inhale and exhale
deeply.


I turn doorknobs
and slide open desk drawers.


I walk through halls
and step on linoleum lines.


And I drive a little too fast
(translated from the original Spanish)
by matthagen

It is a scientific fact that there are beautiful women everywhere you turn.
Over every bite of lunch alone in the 2nd story's foodcourt.

Women who, given a smaller, or more resourcedepleted population
would have deserved jousts.

Women lonelier than I am who are doing everything right, but have no one
to tell them. They deserve someone to tell them

the tie in their hair is done just right, and yes you have
put on just the right amount of blush today. Your jeans look great.

Illtasting Rainbow Grasshoppers stepping out from the between the casavas
sing the epics on their legs for the woman who asked for extra tomatoes.

Women whose faces could never have been fastened to Italian stone,

every figure the same rounded egg with blonded braids,

might whisper approval through the mouthpiece of a telephone,

and I, with a Venus who calls me hers waiting at my own home,

think that it could be me who would greet, extoll and leave

like a purple and yellow insect who has developed no poison as a defense
standing up on a rock to announce itself to a desert floor

an evolutionary hiccup of a squire, who is certain the sword is his
but finds himself eviscerated on a meadhall dancefloor

like when I was 8 years old and a loose shoelace snagged in my bikechain
sending me to the asphalt cheekbone first,

I am an unnoticable shade of brown with pink highlights,

easy to lose in the rocks and dunes, and these women, whose figures will
Inadvertent depression
It's good that I didn't call
Good that I didn't say too much.

Some things are hard to give up
Sometimes it's hard to let go
But I'm giving up
All sorts of things, now.

I don't drive anymore
And I don't eat that much
But I do smoke a lot more
Cigarettes and drink
Beer.
But I always drank
Plenty of beer.

I imagine I'm some sort of
Drinking smoking monk
Living in the kind of solitude
You get when you unplug
And quit calling.

I gave up television
Except for Back to the Future reruns.
Instead I read old books
I try to make notes in the margins.

I haven't written any music
In a long time. My guitars
Are neglected, brokenstringed.

It's been a month since we spoke
And I don't want to talk to you
But I would like to know
that you miss me.

I don't miss you.
I gave up missing you weeks ago
When I washed your perfume
Out of my pillowcases
Exorcised your lingering ghosts.

Every time I clean I find something
A relic
A stupid rubber wristband
That fell behind the bed
Or a ponytail holder
Underneath my journal.

Sequins keep showing up.
I pick them out of the carpet
and a few days later
Find another.

Something tells me
Memories are like waves
And mine are stirring the floor
And washing these bits of you up
Pushing them out of the ocean of our yesterdays
And onto my little bit of shore.

Sunday night (after I drank too much)
I found five sequins
and held them all in my palm.
They were a constellation
Shaped like summer
Like days laying out at the lake
And nights when we couldn't cool off
After we made love
Spread out on the bed
The air wafting in from the window
Barely a whisper
The smell of your sex
And the taste of your sweat
Lingering on my lips.

I looked at them too long
Thought of you too much
Came too close to dialing your number.

That was as much of you
As I'd held
Since you left
And when I held my hand
Over the trash
staring at the ceiling,
As I often do,
A thought comes.


Is this it?
Is the finally THE thought?
The masterpiece I’m searching for?


'I don't really have a head for hats'

Is drinking the stuff makes things risky

You can barely distinguish

Your slurs from your english

Or with whom you've become quite frisky

And the trees have a silver glare;
Past the chimneys high see the vampires fly,
And the harpies of upper air,
That flutter and laugh and stare.

For the village dead to the moon outspread
Never shone in the sunset's gleam,
But grew out of the deep that the dead years keep
Where the rivers of madness stream
Down the gulfs to a pit of dream.

A chill wind blows through the rows of sheaves
In the meadows that shimmer pale,
And comes to twine where the headstones shine
And the ghouls of the churchyard wail
For harvests that fly and fail.

Not a breath of the strange grey gods of change
That tore from the past its own
Can quicken this hour, when a spectral power
Spreads sleep o'er the cosmic throne,
And looses the vast unknown.

So here again stretch the vale and plain
That moons longforgotten saw,
And the dead leap gay in the pallid ray,
Sprung out of the tomb's black maw
To shake all the world with awe.

And all that the morn shall greet forlorn,
The ugliness and the pest
Of rows where thick rise the stones and brick,
Shall some day be with the rest,
And brood with the shades unblest.

Then wild in the dark let the lemurs bark,
And the leprous spires ascend;
For new and old alike in the fold
Of horror and death are penned,
to reach its radiant hand
and smudge some light
on the tattered surface

Poet 1:

Motion

Narrow it down to the relativity, even
Conscious of the extraordinarily vast periphery,
It's hard to fathom.
Delay the slow onset realizations,
of your muscles sensations,
and take a good, hard look at that chasm.
It's a strange notion.
All that
motion.

Masturbation

Some nights,
While I lay in bed,
in fact, most days.
Well, anytime I'm bored out of my head.
I'll do a quick one two, check check test.
As if I was performing.
Just to see if anyone is home,
or they're all deep at rest.
And of course, I'm not really about to perform.
It's more like training,
if training can include watching porn.

Poison

One poison
Two poison
I'm getting cozy.
Inhale deeply into my lungs,
Wash it down with a little rum.
Three poison
Four poison
Now I'm feeling fuckin' toasty,
and I'm getting a little aggressive with my language,
but once you get the hang of it,
it flows a little more smoothly, and even though
I'm feeling a little woozy,
my thoughts are like the ice in a bucket,
and my words the fine wine I'm most certainly not drinking.
But I can't stop thinking  ""Fuck she's hot"",
and someone just offered me another shot.
So now it's 5 poison, 6 poison,
red poison, blue poison.
I know the seventh was pinot noire,
but that blue stuff stung, and
Hold up is that bro getting in a car?
What a fuckin' goof, I don't think I need any more proof
that he's a douch, but I'm pretty aloof
myself, and i've gotta look after my own health.
I think I'll just chill on that windowsill.
So I walked over there and and had a nasty fall.
I shouldn't have mixed all that alcohol.

Poet 2:

Warcraft

if all the witches in the world got together,
there'd be one hell of a shit storm
spells, screams, and torture galore
its thoughts like these
holy shit! i just saw a boar
that i imagine as i walk through Elwynn
leaves rustling on the forest floor
the path is growing narrow and... i see it, the ridge
looking down at my keys, i prepare my hands
and cross that familiar bridge
night falls fast on Westfall's mine
dead
the server sleeps, nobody's online

Lugubrious

look at you
you're so pathetic
why are you even here?
just leave this place, and take that too
that thing you always hold so close
we dont want it here, it isn't pure
...and neither are you
dont do it, dont you dare
infect this world with your solemn looks
your empty stares and depressing books
we are happy and we are free
and most importantly
we are not you

Poet 3:

Juicy

Peter, caving in to his carnal appetite,
was out on the prowl in the dark of the night
seeking the succulent, the tender and sweet
juicy fleshes of the young and petite,
He saw his target, in the moonlight,
oh how his member twitched in delight
and then Peter pounced, manhood erect,
onto the virgin, inside in a sec'
But oh his dismay, when he found out
that it was Aaron, who he was raping about
going forward and back, unable to stop
in a hot, stifling, sweat
as a stranger becomes Brooklyngirl
delicious but not quite destroyed.
She becomes one I've come to know
though its not the way we've been known by others
for it seems we're not alone in this newly found privacy
And a child kills the mood outside the window
as if the moon of our morning
howling us a song of guilt and remembrance.

so much i want to be done with for once and for all,
but everything's metallic and it's welded to my skin.
i'm tired of the searing burn of error after error,
i need clarity,
i need closure,
i need a glass of cold space.

and now rains are falling straighter,
clocks are ticking slower
and every sound is far too amplified.
i'm finding creation slightly more than i can accept.

damn, but i wish life was a river.
a real river, slow but constant,
free of snakes and snapping turtles and pike fish.

i'd lie on my back, eyes halfslit, ears submerged,
where all i could hear was the sound of my own breathing.
i could be perfectly still
and yet i'd never be static.

i'm salting the earth
and sowing the bones of birds into the soil,
determined that nothing will grow here again.
half a world away, you're wondering if i miss you.




""The Day You Left""

The Day you left us
Although so far away
To me it feels like yesterday
We never got to say goodbye
I never got to ask why
So many smiles yet so much pain
With memories that don't fade
Why am I so gloomy
Why am I so sad
This is the way I feel
Since the day you died.
But things aren't as they always seem

What is there left to believe?
These terrible dreams,
of hammers to my teeth?

Once so strong, now so weak
Her blinding gaze loosens my seams
And stitching once so pristine,
fails again, with innards set free.

A lonely man left to bleed,
says:
""Please, just take my hand and stay with me.""

I can't have you
I probably could.
I think it's because
of the cracks
that line your eyes
and the white
that grays
your hair.
I think it's,
maybe,
your backpack
that's ripping apart
at the seams;
that you're a man
in a small boy's shoes.
Maybe it's your pages
and your books
and the way
you always pretend
that you're not
really looking at me,
but behind me.
I think maybe
it's because
you think
that you can't
have me
dropping coins in wishingwells,
just emptying your pockets,
because you couldn't stand
I gently ash it.
Again I seduce it,
bring it to my lips,
and with a tap,
extinguish its bright flame.
So ends the life of one cigarette,
and so begins the life of another:
I pull my lighter out,
and caress the new cig
with a flick of flint.

I worry that this kiss
will be the only one I have
tonight.




Stab me, goddamnit! I don’t wanna breathe anymore,

every breath is shit without the silver clouds of before.

I miss every particle of death, of dreary disease.

I miss its grip tight unto me, it’s menacing grin with no intention of release.

Oh, what I wouldn’t trade to stare into death’s dead eyes,

I feel mine tearing up as I tell myself countless lies.

“It will get better”, the lying lips of longing speak,

and I have trouble distinguishing between addiction and crushing defeat.

I know with every breath of gray, I might choke,

I kept an arm on the iron table to hold it still and
It left an argyle of diamonds on my skin.
It didn’t matter since I became a table for one.
You never arrived, and no one else was about.

The plaza fried up from below, all the fountains
Wiggled peroxidewhite in the sun.
Think of getting trapped in a room night
after night when you were small.
Remember getting sick from going
over bumps in the road.

I watched the clock on the courthouse.
Black and winding went its hands around its face.
Masses of things tried to change me to what I was not.
Thank god the world is sick with puzzles.
Thank god some pieces have been mislaid
In shady places we never find.

If I Were Breaking Up with A Girl This is What I Would Say

The snails they always run but the thieves they slowly walked.
And you know I get a dime for every time a politician talked.
He threw a feather out to sea and it returned a tack,
Frustrated he remarked ""At least you're giving something back!""
I want to stay connected so I bought myself a phone,
Then I realized that I am connected, its those people that're alone.
So baby don't you see I've got all these things inside my head
You say you want to know me, go know yourself instead.

My father tried to tell me before I was too old,
""Work hard now my son, It'll pay off a hundred fold"".
I said ""who the hell am I to listen to something like that?
All I want right now dad, is just a brand new leopard skin pillbox hat""
I went to the barber shop, where they tried so hard to cut my hair,
the barber said ""it's much too long to cut, for god's sake I wouldn't dare""
So baby is it obvious, I've got all these things inside my head,
I know you've got them too so go know yourself instead.

The fans are always spinning in the superhuman room,
Trying to cool the heads, studying their doom.
But every time you learn something, you pay the price of being alone.
That's still better than paying in blood, especially your own.
So you see baby these things weigh me down like lead,
and if you don't leave me now honey, they'll crush you instead.

I told this to a man and he said these things aren't really real.
""Yes but does your stomach ever ask you when it's deciding how to feel?""


and knock with the sound of bells

because when our butterflies left their cocoons
empty and decaying
their kindled unspeakable spirits
whisked us away to decaying mountaintops

to count my blessings

before going to bed, but now

I count up my mistakes like sheep,

and every single one

starts and ends

with you.


I remember when we went to the farm

to pick peaches

and you found the perfect one

round and soft and sweet.

You threw it to me,

and told me to be careful

not to crush it.


I saw you a few weeks ago

through a frosted window,

sitting in a coffee shop

and reading Rilke,

feeling like you woke up

and I didn't,

feeling like I was watching

someone else's version

of my own movie. I wondered what would happen

if I turned around,

if I turned around and looked up

at the cold sky, if I peeled it back

from the corners, watched it all fall

and caught it between my hands

before it touched the concrete.

Would you come out?


Would you come out

to tell me, ""careful,

now:

don't crush it.""

We had goldfish and they circled around and around
in the bowl on the table near the heavy drapes
covering the picture window
and my mother, always smiling,
wanting us all to be happy, told me,  ‘be happy Henry!’
and she was right: it’s better to be happy if you can.


But my father continued to beat her
and me several times a week while
raging inside his 6foottwo frame
because he couldn’t understand what was attacking him from within.

My mother, poor fish, wanting to be happy,
beaten two or three times a week, telling me to be happy:
‘Henry, smile! why don’t you ever smile?’

And then she would smile, to show me how,
and it was the saddest smile I ever saw.

One day the goldfish died, all five of them,
they floated on the water, on their sides, their eyes still open,
and when my father got home he threw them to the cat
there on the kitchen floor
and we watched as my mother smiled

Charles Bukowski



I have loved you since I first laid eyes on you three years ago.

I love the way you have the most ridiculous bed head in the morning
The way you check the trees out the window every time you pass them.


I love the way you put a little too much sugar in your coffee
The way you blast your music as you drive to work
How perfectly you park your car
The way you will hold the elevator for a stranger
The way you get frustrated at the copy machine
And how you never go to lunch alone.

I love the way you are always the first person to take the tough assignments
The way you always have free time to listen to others
The way you stay late to help your coworkers
How you drive by the reservoir most days on your way home


I love how you call your mother every week
How your dinner is always homemade and fresh
How you will sometimes fall asleep while watching TV
And I love the sound of your deep breaths as you lie sleeping.


I love the look on your face when I accidentally startle you awake.

And I hate you.

I hate you because three years ago you said no and got that restraining order.

But you’ll see.
One day you’ll love me back and I’ll remove the cameras.
I’ll get rid of the GPS units I’ve hidden.
I’ll return all the random items of yours I have acquired.

And until that day, I will be here.
Because
Every undressing
a reckoning for the anger I feel
toward you
Cheeks and cunt vermilion,
I am bruised carnelian, whimpering and still
Being demanded apologies from someone who isn’t sorry
but should be.
I beg like it’s the first time we met
you were cruel and sardonic, and looking back,
I think you knew
We could turn violence to therapy.

Suddenly a loveliness to the weight you’ve put upon me.

You think I’ve excused you.
Make no mistake:
I never give you consent,
my oppression and trauma are mine,
you’ve taken too much of my shame, and
I still hate you, but
please,
please,
I am pretentious and preposterous
Thinking my paragraphs
Presented as planned
Would provide passion
Plotted in such a way
Spread across the page.
How arrogant do I have to be
To claim a throne of literacy?
I am no consonant king or victor of vowels.
I am a potentate of intellectual pap.
Pity me please, I am playing pretend.
Idle words won’t raise the dead.
Hollow nouns have no effect
On pictureperfect, peaceful hearts.
A promise kept is only pain instead.
If I could resurrect or captivate
With the position my pen takes
Paper would be my paradise:
A perpetually pious literary device.

But this is only poetry.


My mind is racing,

Eyes aching.

So much to see,

To learn,

To know,

I’m breaking.

All the threads,

The links,

The thoughts,

Not pacing.

Absorbing

As much as I can;

Just thinking.

So little time,

Today,

This week,

This month,

Not stopping.

My life stops;

No food,

No drink,

Just reading.

It goes on and on;

More threads,

More links,

More thinking,

But I’m crashing,

So much to do,

And I’m crashing.

Just take another,

One pill,

One breath,

One life,

And I’m living.

I go on

and on

and on,

still searching.

But never finding.


Because I can grow more in my imagination

Than I can in this world.



All of reality stripped to the bone,

Creating my own metaphysical reformation

Where my illusions become uncurled.



Finally, grasping at the unknown.

As I create the perfect salvation,

don’t you know skin
is just packaging? and sometimes
it gets scraped and scratched and creased when
it’s passing through all those hands in the mail, but still
i want to get where i’m going.
i’m not damaged goods.
A smile formed across my lips… You were nothing like them.





Like a scared child you would snatch a peek over your purse,
And my eyes would stare back, like I was under a curse.





A sudden pain in my stomach, I can’t wait any longer,
I have to know your name, and possibly your number.
The school bells ring and I’m rudely awoken,
And now I think of all the things that went unspoken.





In truth, you’re someone I never really met…
Just a regret that I can never forget.



There were reasons, you know

That I never told you about the river in Luang Prabang—

The murky ripples swallowing my ankles and the sand

Mixing with the blondes of my hair.

It was monsoon that day, and the statues all looked at me

eyes burnt out, staring at the sun
limp dicks in hand, crying for god
junkies thanking their crank
for a reason to exist

progress!
(onward)
progress!
(further up)
progress!
(further in)


the last good and true suicide;
a public execution

Romulus!

the jury is hung


the grapes of our wrath  rotting in the sun
the first of our fruit
the edges of our field
given to the memory of dead soldiers

give us this,
I hate my life,
I'd like to end it,
with a knife.

If I could die,
instead of live,
to charity,
my shit I'd give.

but all my things,
when grouped en masse,
are of  less worth,
than passing gas.

so I will wait,
and moan and weep,
until the day,
my soul will sleep.

So tip your servers,
treat them well,
for while you wait,
they wait in Hell.

I am the heavy brown branch where tired crows cry;
I am the anarchy of a thousand hurried breaths
breathing life from the ruins of a thousand hurried deaths.



And I am where the spiders go to beat the beating black,
under the table where the moldy brown basket sits
A little girl's love was poured. But now she is gone.
A decade passes, then one more,
till no one feels sad to say her name,
I don't feel
like we're going
but if I have my way,
your grain will fall first



Some of us drink.
Some of us don’t.
I am of the former.
Fuck the righteous.

Everyday, I give of myself
To help the poor, huddled, stupid masses
I am dying, while they live

Every day.

“Help me!  Help me!”
But you won’t help me, help you!

Panicked.
Guttural.
Bellowing.
Crying out for God to help them.
What am I doing here?
I am not God
But I am the closest to God you are going to get today

Bleating.
Lowing.
Resistance.

This cycle continues.
No respite.
Who will help the helpers?

The fog of the mind sets in.
For a moment, the world is fine.
I will sleep tonight.
I’m in heaven.

Maybe I'll wake up
Maybe I'll just sleep,
Maybe I'll stand still
Inside this terrifying dream.

It's coming to an end.
Where that is I'm not sure.
All I know is now.
And I'm running out of steam.

I'm inside this conscious prison
The bars of the world
Are all I know.
My life is tearing at the seams.

So where do I fit in,
Which puzzle piece am I?
Am I the easy corner,
Or was I left inside the box.

If I pull the ripcord now
I may never reach the ground.
But what to see anyway?
Just dirt and metal and rocks.

I'm an optimistic pessimist.
A mouse inside a fruitful cage.
The tools to survive,
But none to really live.




could you?

Express your love and loyalty?

if it was beautiful

and it smelled sweet

then maybe its petals would represent our trust.

and when the last one falls, you would buy me a new one

till the day I'd come home, and see a wilted; naked flower.

then I would know

we were over.

and you would have no reason to call

and tell me,

you were deserting me.

then I'd buy some flower seeds

and plant a garden.

and drop all of the flowers you had given me

into the ground.

and they would decay, like we once did.

but fertilize new life.


after you leave

you will decompose...

in my heart.

and fertilize my new beginnings.

New Hope.

“Every last one of us,” we assure ourselves.
And without fail we wake up, flounder in the morning sun, work, and fuck.
when working and fucking was decreed to be our collective dream.
And now, with no more saintly animals to chew us up,
our stagnant masses can work and fuck their way to becoming
the frosting on the cake celebrating our triumph over natural selection.



Piled atop one another, generation on generation,
like coarse layers of biogeological sediment,
the youngest of us the squirming top soil born at the very edge
of the Earth’s orbit, clinging to our older brothers’ coattails
so we don’t drift off into that black space between here and Mars.
You and I will be the unlucky ancestors, sojourners of “sea level,”
the bottom layer where the heat and pressure of our progeny
have mashed us into a wet, peoplecolored paste. And by peoplecolored,
I don’t mean the irrelevant skin, but the helpless pink and white
of our insides. The worst of us will have gathered and condensed into dark,
infertile splotches. Like the tough lumps buried in the flesh of a potato.



“Any sign of the meteor yet?” asks some buried voice.
“Not yet” says a scout at the surface.
“How about a solar storm?”
“Maybe a small one.”
“Tomorrow,” we say, “tomorrow we are definitely doomed.”

The window shatters, the body crumbles,
Shards fly through the air like a beetle, molasses,
A moment’s horror, a moment’s realization
Barely bare fruition,
And time stops.

Her hands are smooth, lips are trembling,
Closer and pressed tighter like a mother its long lost child,
A moment’s release, a moment’s desire
Ignite intrinsic grace,
And time stopped.  And began again.  Far too soon.

Forever only lasts as long as a frozen second.

The goodbyes were said with no lingering dread,
The smiles melt any ice, and they live with the choice,
And so die with the choice to open the door,
Die with the choice to drive through an average intersection,
Die with the choice hung on another man’s neck,
The choice to swill, to refuse, to hold pride,
The choices collide in the moment time stops,
That which ended leaves a crystallized fiancé,
A man whose drunken revelries thrust him through the fray,

To the Girl on her Cell Phone in the Panera Bread

When the quiche
that you bought and subsequently
microwaved passes your lips;
and the buttery flavor
with its pencillead aftertaste
sends signals through your spine,
making your brain feel real pleasure
for the first time, since the shower
you took last night,
which I'm sure you didn't share
with your phone, though
it is conceivable
your best friend was standing
in the hallway, all ears,
holding a freshly laundered towel,
beyond the open door exhaling
steam wroth with lilac, swollen
with the successive stories that your tongue,
even coated in egg and refined white flour,
and salty pork and flecks of spinach,
and the cheap oil they use,
instead of milk,
and rather than butter,
is still flittering with:


No one can impede its flow.

Flow of blood through years of warring,

Warring spreads where humans go.


Go reclaim your long lost values,

Values molded by good men,

Men whose sons have set great fires,

Fires soon shall burn again.


Again the chains have taken root,

Root out evil while you're able,

Able men are being tortured,

Tortured men make worlds unstable.
for there's no one that will do it for you
and if not, then don't.
The world is a big place, and whatever
you choose to do, you won't be missed.
So smile you heartless bastard.

Smile,
like big tiger from ear to ear,
even if it hurts your cheeks,
and laugh, even if it cuts your throat,
for there's no one else who will do it for you,
and no one sings for a mime.

Smile
and try to not drown,
in all those tears for mankind,
dead men care little if you weep for them,
and none of them can help you live.
So smile you heartless bastard,

when the needle bit my skin


I bit my lip


and waited for that myth


The euphoria better than sex

The world stopping, silent

FINALLY






And when I stood up

The waves came crashing in

And my blood icy

And I knew




Why people throw everything away

for a spoonful

Why skeletons can't manage shame

when they disappear



Why my friend stayed up three hours

after I went too far

and went to bed

to make sure I was still breathing



I can do anything and make it through

As long as there's still fight

somewhere in me



It doesn't mater if my veins

want to collapse

And I'm told

who is afraid of me dying

who couldn't decipher my opiate babel



It doesn't matter how long

my eyes roll back in my head for

Or that it doesn't bother me

to own a hummingbird heart




Because I already told the ghosts,

months ago on a different coast,

that there's still some fight in me



""I guess that means we halfassed

Sleep with me in my bed.
And lack of sex and losing bets
Lie heavy on my head.


I write her name and search again
Her face does not appear
I dread her eyes, but miss her thighs
And breath upon my ear.


I hope she's good, but not too good
I hope that she's just fine.
So to be frank I'll have this wank
And finish off this wine.





If you can keep your head when all about you

Are losing theirs and blaming it on you;

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

But make allowance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,

Or, being hated, don't give way to hating,

And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise;



If you can dream  and not make dreams your master;

If you can think  and not make thoughts your aim;

If you can meet with triumph and disaster

And treat those two imposters just the same;

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken

Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to broken,

And stoop and build 'em up with wornout tools;




If you can make one heap of all your winnings

And risk it on one turn of pitchandtoss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

And never breath a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

To serve your turn long after they are gone,

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

Except the Will which says to them: ""Hold on"";



If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,

Or walk with kings  nor lose the common touch;

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you;

If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

With sixty seconds' worth of distance run

Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,

And  which is more  you'll be a Man my son!

Old age should burn and rage at close of day;

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,

Because their words had forked no lightning they

Do not go gentle into that good night.


Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright

Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.


Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,

And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,

Do not go gentle into that good night.


Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight

Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.


And you, my father, there on the sad height,

Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.

Do not go gentle into that good night.

Rage, rage against the dying of the light.






I've seen the trenches, I've dug with my hands... I'm asking you a question.



Take it away, little by little, day by day



Go on. Go.



It was never about the dirt under my feet or the fire in my wake.



It was the wait.



I couldn't begin to explain the hours. They crawl with desolation.



There is no end.



I'm a mirage in the eye of the storm. I am a thought that passes.



Grabbing at branches. Turning stones along this path.



Here, but not.



I will always hold this shadow. I will always bare these scars.



If it means having to die at the foot of the sun, I will.



I need to know it exists.




An eternity alone?

when your phone dialed me
ankles caught
in a denim vice
you tripped
over your anxiety,
cursing
as you pressed end.

there are shards of guilt

spread out amongst the forgotten.


Fractions and fragments.


Large and small.


How many pieces

will I have to collect?


How long until

I can't any more?


How long until

I can see it all clearly
How the pieces we taped
Unfit, but crafty
They let themselves unravel
and we crumbled back to the ground


Our hands were needing, so we found the hold
to keep the black hole from swallowing our soul
Your touch was electric,
Infinite and trusting
But now it pulses with uncertainty
I wish I could hold on to you


Two absolute alike
Caught vulnerable and hungry
Keep me compelled; bring me fire
Tell me not the math, but rather the fervent
And when you pull me,
rip me apart or kiss me slowly

a lot

when i talk to you,

because I want

to capture you

in crystallized perfection.

And I try

to forget that


I tell myself

as I smile

at my reflection

in the morning.

""I'm strong.""

I think as I

drive to work

and appreciate

the grey sky.

""I'm strong.""

I whisper as I

smoke a cigarette

and check to see

if you called.

(You hadn't)

""I'm strong.""

I remind myself

between tears

as I crawl

into bed

alone


They gave you direction, they gave you suggestion

They gave you a chart, sized up your credentials

Checked a few boxes, assigned you a bottle

Because making you think

Doesn't fit with the sync,

Handle it chemically, deal with these drugs,

Don't consider the future, just stitch up the suture.


If it feels better now  surely that's all that matters.

Ritalin ruined a whole generation,

Silenced, reformulated, reassigned as Adderall

New age Thalidomide.

Deal with our problems?

No, we'll hide.







to the young girl

who sat next to me

at the bar

with that almost black hair

and those almost purple eyes

and that smell of almost berries.


You let me buy you a drink

after I told you

I was a writer.


""No one's ever written

a poem

about me.""


You let me kiss

the nape of your neck,

your shoulder,

your lips.


And then you left

with some young cock.

Now my fingers smell

of almost berries.


Fuck you,

Turn off the clocks, cut the telephone,

stop the dog barking with a juicy bone?

No, let him bark; he won’t last long.

Sip the coffee, read the paper,
drive to work, come home;

he’ll be there waiting, but not for long.

Dogs don’t live forever, nor do men;

not even dogs who were somebody's best friend.

He’s graying now, and moving slow,

but sometimes you see it still so happy, still so full

of that same joy he had

when you brought him home.

You were eight years old, he was a ball of fur;

now you’re trying to be a man, still trying to grow,

and back at home he’s almost gone.

Will you be there to see him go?

Will he know you love him, that he’s a good boy?

Please, there’s no need to dismantle the sun;

just play with your puppies while they’re still young.



And when your dog is dead and gone,

find a new one, take him home;

and try to love him even more

than you ever loved the one before;

and always remember, it isn’t only dogs

who come and go, like a short sweet song

your mother, father, sister too,

they won’t last long.

And all those family dinners will be done.

So while you’re home for Christmas, be forewarned!

What seems so solid now will one day turn to ash.

So please, do not trouble yourself with cash,

or fame or martyrdom;

just remember who loves you,

and love them in return.

When I said

“I love your dress”

And everything we did

That sunny day

Her skin was so soft

Radiant

And she laughed

At all of my jokes

I smile – so vivid

All of that

From her scent

On my clothes
to look into the eyes of the
sun

i was fourteen years old when i learned
that's where the fun is


i was fourteen years old when a manicdepressive
named Dave
who lived with me in the
rathole group home by the river
invited me to his place for
dinner with his family

i was then the lowest creature
on the social totem pole
and i guess it must have been
my intelligence and manners that
won me that invitation,
since i was the only one in that
rathole who could go more that two
minutes without cursing a sky across
the room, regardless of company.


Dave and i went for a walk before dinner,
through the nowdrowsing streets of
uppermiddle class suburbia,
where the secretaries
and foremen
and administrators
made their homes.

He told me to keep my eyes open for
a soda can.
i did, and it was fully half an hour
before the manicured streets
spat forth a single rotten tooth
labeled CocaCola

Dave pulled a pin from out of his collar
and punched twentyfive neat holes in a square
on a flattened face of the can.
from his pocket he produced a wee
little baggie, littler by far than any i'd
seen before.
he pulled some bud out and placed it on his
homebrewed hibachi

and i swear on my name and on the face of GOD,
when i held that black BIC in my right hand,
poised to set this new, wonderful and frightening
experience to the flame,
and struck the flint,

i swear on my name and on the face of GOD,
i looked into the eyes of the sun,
and they weren't angry,
or happy, or even interested.

they were wild, drill sergeant, last twenty on
Santa's Little Helper, desperate,
mad eyes
ten times on shreds of tissue

Stuck one with spit
to the tip of each finger

Curled my hands
Like I held blossoming roses

And watched the wind pluck
each frayed petal

They danced before me
as the breeze carried them home

Cheers!  I hope you find this helpful!






as I ran them across the stubble on my chin

I'm numb

An empty campus lay under blankets of snow

and I'd forgotten what shade of grass would grow

Still numb

The lamps glowed, hanging their halos

overhead and the glassy path below

Still numb

A girl who could light her cigarettes with her smile

smoked one alone in the frigid cold

Still numb

I put it behind me and crossed the road

almost to the warm place that I call home...

are words that i’ve said so often
that i’ve almost convinced myself
that it’s true

but it’s not for me, is it?
it’s for everyone else
i don’t want to deal with the questions
or the pity
because i don’t care about it

i fancy myself the scarecrow
tall, stoic
ultimately empty
or the oak
with wisdom beyond my years
planted firmly
unmoving

but perhaps, on some level
i’m more the flower
all the tools
necessary to survive
but frail
destroyed with improper handling

i’m just tired, i say
and some see my lie
few will press on
to no avail
and the rest leave it be

another day, maybe
they’ll think to themselves
the crows will swallow their fear
and rip this scarecrow apart
and all of the straw
will coming spilling out
and i hope
on that day
they’re ready
for what that straw

They say true love one day you will find
And still I keep looking over my shoulder
My dreams are where the fires burn bright
Yet by light of day they fade and smolder

They say the truth will set you free
The truth is I am all alone
Freedom is all I truly have
Wandering still to seek a home

They say great men dare to dream by day
From these nightmares I wish I could wake
I say, at night my life is my own
By day fear holds what's mine to take



a watched pot will never boil,

Misguided men,
Waiting in transfer,
time and again,
The lines on her lips,
Sing a sad song,
The strength in her grips,
Struggles lifelong,
Though eyes tell us tales,
Hers tell us none,
Hidden from details,
Long lost loved one,
She speaks of a road,
In dreams she’s walked,
A path which had slowed,
The road is blocked,
The beaten path falls,
Leaves in the road,
The white raven calls,
Lightens its’ load,
She wakes up in sweat,
Tears on her cheeks,
Her breathing offset,
Comfort she seeks,
That cold day we met,
I knew her well,
Like Russian roulette,
That night I fell,
Life filled with no err,
Many have sought,
Others have failed her;
But I will not,
Perfect Equation


The Perfect Equation

Before you ask about the grid
I drew on your face, understand my compulsion
to graph you out. I can’t simplify  you,
the quiet interval between my heartbeat.
Warm in your grasp, you are pulling me
into a cozy alcove, the easy slope in the crook
of your arm around my waist, whispering
to me as you lead me to the backyard.
I wish I could embrace
being lost like you.

Before you say there is no difference between us,
there is and it is not positive.
I am a negative slope, crossing the axis,
tilting my earth out of orbit, uncontrolled
but you draw me  in like gravity. I am your skeptic
angel, not soft but hard, not feathered but stone.
I want to reach you. The arches of my feet lift up,
and when our lips intercept
I am still obsessed
with the space in between us.

Before you start erasing your name
from my variables, consider my addiction
to equations. I am  trying  to enclose you in brackets,
to pigeonhole you in my broken function.
But you are mystery, a boundless pair
of brown eyes lit up with flecks of golden hieroglyphs.
So when you set me down on a patch of grass;
I am lost until I find on my map, my point of origin
residing within the curve
of your ear to ear smile.

Before you start counting down from ten,
please be patient. I have a penchant for numbering
our days, even though you are always a constant.
Your worth is my absolute value,
shining bright this evening, in the night sky,
where stars are hung as fixtures,
like  a scattergram. In the mixture of these
highlighted coordinates,  you draw pictures
out of this blackness and
call them constellations.

Before we continue our midnight adventure,
remember that with you, I am prime, undivided.
I am whole with no remainder.
So tonight, I won’t  count the buttons
that you untangle from my shirt’s holes.
I won’t measure the temperature
of your cold hands on my skin.
When you kiss me I concede
that not everything needs
to be worked out.

Where the bruises used to be, now makeup takes their place.

She muffles sobs of agony, as drunken snores fill the room.
By day he threatens violence, by night he follows through.

For years her minds been searching, for an escape route she could take.
Every time she packs her things, he beats her till she breaks.

Her mother died some years ago, her father's locked away.
She feels alone inside this world, her life so very grey.

By day when he is off at work, she plays with his pistol in her hand.
She holds it out and screams out loud,
I'll kill you where you stand!

In her heart she knows she can't, he's the man she used to love.
She takes a bow to the cold hard ground, his fists rain down from above.

Today her soul is broken, no tears are flowing through.
In her hand she holds the key, her freedom coming soon.

Her mouth is fully open, gun powder rushes in.
The bullets left the building, a drop of blood lands on her chin.

Her husband sits in jail, her body told the story.
Her final work of art, was enough to sway the jury.

Her paintbrush was a trigger, her easel was the ceiling.

I spent my first year in America mute, unable to speak the language,
but I understood it when the other kids in first grade said
my head looked like an egg, laughed at my ignorance of the word
vagina,
and asked how best
to cook dogs. I wanted to tell them that hot dogs are best cooked
by shoving them up their ass, but I didn’t have the word for
ass,
or a verb as visceral as shove.

I made a vow to always have the words. I learned English and
I learned how to write. I learned that every situation can be defused
with surgical phrasing and every insult
can be turned with a better insult.
Later in life I learned wordplay as foreplay. I escaped my silent prison.

There are still times when I don’t have the words.
When stoned  when transfixed by a Jackson Pollock  when asked to comment
on an expensive wine paired perfectly (I’m told) with a charcuterie course.
I didn’t have the words when your father died of liver failure.
I didn’t have a hug.

Ones that never completely reach her eyes.

She claims to be happy

Has she fooled herself, I sometimes wonder.

For one need not be strong,

If they allow nobody inside.

It is easier to distrust and shun

Avoid the possiblility of hurt,

Of affection turned to jealousy,

Of good intentions becoming vile.

I hold out my hand, and she hesitates,

Smile faltering, for the briefest moment.

She is not ready, I can see, to trust again.

I take back my hand, and sit down.

It’s okay, I can wait.

I do not know her story,

Nor does it really matter what that is.

When she needs me, I’ll lend an ear.

Place roses at its feet and graze its forehead.
Chant the comings and goings of the nights and days.


The Summers it will never sweat.
The Winters it'll never shake.


I'll open its mouth and exhale
a fools attempt to a longing which never ceases.

I'll cup its hands and press them to lips
keeping a secret never told.

I'll bring my ear to its heart and hear a faint thumping
the panting of a forgotten beast.

And I'll know, I'll listen.
My love is dead but never ceasing.
My love is dead but forever beating.


calluses that peel and crack are stained with nicotine.

My yellow eye and crooked spine are skitzo paranoid.

Bionic blond atomic bombshell nuclear android.

And I'm all twisted up inside  a human state of being

psychotropics pills perfection laxative junky queen.

A galaxy of chemicals to water me down

don't know how I got here with my wrists and ankles bound.

Dreams are for the dead I've said  I dream only of sleep

and an afterlife of unprotected sex and poppy fields

wired on amphetamines  short circuit burn out spark

put me on your morphine drip and keep my cellar dark.

Alcohol brings me down

to latex gloves hospital gowns

direct me to the lost and found

Shhh... it's late don't make a sound.

I'm so ugly  break my mirror

I'm so dirty  rinse paint thinner

I'm so loud  couldn't be clearer

I'm so bored  harder and harder

I'm so pretty  rape my image

I'm so empty  rape and pillage

I'm so bought  I can't be sold



when we really met.



but you could never quite get my name right.

i was the friend of your little sister the whats her name of whatever.

was it tiffany. tami. tina.

tina.

but it was okay.



you sort of snorted when i said I didn’t know what i wanted to be.

you’re 11.



and jumped in.

and the years passed.

and you showed me the correct way to shoot pool.

and how to row with only one oar.

and that squirt guns really do work better if you aim them.

and the best way to make macaroni.


tina.


and the years passed.


and how i wish i could ask you questions. about if i’m grown up yet.

and if it’s still okay that i haven’t figured it out.

and i want to tell you i now know the difference between an IPA and a Lager.

but it seems now, I can’t. you’ve jumped again.

at 23 i learn you’re gone.

this wasn’t the post i was supposed to write.

and this wasn’t the way you were supposed to die.


and it was yourself that got to you in the end.

and i find myself in all my 12 year old girlishness weeping.

praying for the day that we will sometime meet, again.

climbing dimensions
like stepladders,
a toddler trying
to reach some
cosmic cookie jar.
I cherish the crumbs
I find in my sheets.

I’ve always had a sweet tooth
its moisture, a surprise from below.
It's overlooked, at times
The greatness of the ground

What with the Book
and the Building
stamping its heart
From the inside out.

From within the soil
there blossoms a white rose.
It opens itself to the filthy air
Staining its fair skin red.

There's no time for reason
back down and retreat
the Chosen are coming
with blood on their feet.
a very
poetic thing

But then again here
i am
writing a poem

about one.



I held my fathers hand today, but he wasn't there with me
He looked my way and smiled a bit, but I don't think he could see
My tears I hold until I'm alone, I want to be so strong
Maybe he should just give up, is thinking that so wrong?

I held my fathers hand today, but I don't think he was there
And mother holds, and rubs, his arm, sat on a plastic chair
And the pipes and tubes and sticky bits are holding him in place
He's tired of life and all this pain, I can read it in his face

I held my fathers hand today, and told him how I cared
About the things we laughed about and stories that we shared
The last thing that he said to me, ""take care, I love you son""
he told me that he had been blessed, to spend this life with mum.

I held my fathers hand today, I know he didn't feel me
the greatest love that I could give was holding him so near me
his eye lids close and I kiss his head and I comb his thinning hair
I say goodbye to my beloved dad, but he doesn't know I'm there.

I held my fathers hand today, but I wasn't there at all
But in my dreams he comes to me, every time I call
And things are like they always were, where everything's alright


This will be a two week contest. The results will be announced May 27th.
I'm no raid dater
I'll just roll for loot and see you later.

Guild drama fills my rage bar;
to the loot fits and rage quits
I say ""tough shit"".
I'd sooner be flirting with a murloc
than trying to find a soulmate in a guildmate.

But in the throne of tides, when I fought at your side,
it was a revelation;
I didn't think about meters once we met;
I just wanted to be exalted in your reputation.

nor his roll on your blue boots upset your groove.
I tried to play a white knight in a black robe and voted to kick,
but you shut it down quick and whispered:
""don't worry, we'll run one when he's done. Want to come?""

I logged on to your server on mumble,
and when I heard you my heart stumbled;
my words fumbled as a girl's determined voice
gave strats as your pally pulled pats.
No damsel, looking for knights,
but better by a damned sight;
a lady knight looking for fights.
I'd duel you, but I'm no fool,
and I'd rather we were a team in 2v2.

I know a nice canalside spot in Stormwind;
we can meet here once we clear this dungeon
(business before pleasure;
and I want you to know I can bring home the treasure;
I'm not saying you're a gold farmer,
but I want you to be a dwarf lady of leisure).

We can relax with a few potions while the griffins fly by,
and while you can't see my tshirt with a tuxedo on it,
I can be suaver when we're dodging lava than in any fine lounge bar,
and more of a gentleman over webcam than any man since Adam.

I know it's our first level,
but I feel I could take on a boss fight.
Before this night,
I never believed in love before first sight.
I know it'd be absurd
to be talking about the 'M' word,
but while for the moment I'm happy to tweet,


Cold sea of concrete
Rubber rivers
tied with shoelace snakes
The throaty chatter of steel stallions

Blast, Blast your battle horns
This briefcase battalion
This trench coat warfare
Holed up in your towers of glass

Unsheathe the weapon
Stabbing, bleeding inky black
A letterhead phalanx
Advance, Advance they say

Not today my friend,

Not today






At your betrayal,
My slavering dog rage
led me on long walks
to still places where
I frightened off lovers
and howled alone.

Grief and I became
as grudging friends then
to trudge handin hand and
stand eyes downcast by
waters of slategrey.

I begged him always
to help me forget
and repeated washings
buried your bright scent

but with numb trembling
chalk hands too weary
to hold strength or purpose
I would too often
find your cruelties in
keepsakes of love
and your words left for me.

Still the accusing walls
scream more memories
and our tiny refuge
will never quite
be my own home
but it will never be
truly empty.

Your abscence
is still here.







There is NO truth.
Only soothing lullabies.
And sedation for
Your seditious thoughts
If you cannot stomach lies.

What's a man to do,
Who knows this truth,
If he cannot compromise?
Continue down
The path you're on.
Stood face to face, and back to back,
To the Ace of Spades and the Queen of Hearts.
But without support, the House would fall apart.

Forsaking jacks and timbres, they called on the pawns.
Faceless subjects, to lean upon.
The Numbers greatly helped to carry the load,
And so the Royal House began to grow.

Outward it grew, as the ramparts grew higher.
Not a Diamond was spared to construct towering spire.
The Clubs were charged with the outer defense,
They built the portcullis, and a great walled defense.

But the Winking Jack began to slip
the King lost more than his sword's grip.
""More Numbers!"" The Ace's despairing call,
But it was too late the Queen started to fall.

Dissent came from within, between the Red and Black.
Each one had planned a subvert attack.
They waited until the House had grown quite large
Just so clever.
The master of picks,
Tumblers and levers.
They gave me a challenge,
I accepted with pride.
To be thrown in a dungeon,
And locked up inside.
I've cracked many locks,
with just a stiff hair.
So I had no fear,
Till they tossed me in there.
As I looked around,
I found with a shock.
I had the right keys,
Love (an enigma in ten syllables)
You (another, in six.)

Three words drop off my tongue,
Like little lead bullets,
And shatter the floor beneath me.

Telling me it exists.
It's annoying.
""Hey!"" It says, ""Turn me on! Use me!""
I cover it with a sock so I can sleep.
No good:
I still know it's there, saying
""turn me on. use me.""
I close my eyes for the 100th time
wishing I had a blue LED
and someone to see it.
I fell in love
With a very sad boy,
Who cried at night
While his parents told him
to, ""Man up.""

Once,
I went to school
And I watched him eat alone
So I sat near him
And told him about a rose bush
I had found,
And then promised to show him.

Once,
I heard a thank you
I saw a smile
That lit up the world
And I lit up with it

Once,
I fell in love
And he did too.

But it only took
Once
For his demons
To win.

So once,
I woke up
To a too late plea
For someone to please
Please
""Help me.""

Once,
I wrote sad words
For a room full
Of death.

Once,
The school's rose bush
Was found cut and dead

Once,
I found his name
Marked on a lifeless stone
And screamed to the carver
His stone was no good.
For this boy's heart
Could never be that cold.

Once,
I fell in love
With a very sad boy
And laid roses on his grave
Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night
By: Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rage at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it in its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.

Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

And you, my father, there on the sad height,
Curse, bless me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Let me know what y'all think..
a cheap shaken cocktail
that tastes of everything melancholic
beneath the sleeves
of my thrift store sweater
my skin is sticky, swollen, dripping
caked with drying indecision
to make my great escape
or risk further exposure to disappointment
""waste not, want not""
yet here I am
wasting spent potential and pocket change
on third rate gin
and wanting nothing more

and you can see

way too deep

inside of me.

.

My organs are spilling through my bones

faster, the harder you squeeze

and the juices from my heart are

dripping down my bony knees.
A game I do not wish to play
Her heart sits upon the hour hand
And mine upon the second
Each moment we spend apart, sends me back another day.
Luckily for me, I know, time must have a limit
There is only so far back to go
Before I face the finish
At least I know i'm never far
I'll pass her by once a minute.

has taught me
anything,
it's that deep, deep down
I'm a very

Like two hearts tied together

Water’s sipped from parted lips
And finally our hips align.

Supine Sundays limbs entwined
Hours slip through fingertips
Your hands take trips along my spine.

I'll drink yours and you'll taste mine
Our tongues eclipse
Our hips align.

In wrinkled sheets we've built our shrine
A trace of salt upon our lips
Ice drips down a sinuous spine.

With twilight comes a sip of wine
Sunday slips
Our lips align.

Tightened grips
And waltzing hips
A shock of heat moves up my spine


Light cascaded across the horizon after summers first full moon





bloodstain
on white tissue
like abstract art


SUICIDE

bloodstain
on city streets




that they threw at me




One too many times they’ll rip open at
The bone and my hands will cripple with arthritis.
But I can’t resist it.
It’s like crack to crack.
It’s like little bubbles stuffed between my bones
Like bumper cars or cells under a microscope.
The bubbles divide like the ones in your sink and divide and build
and pressure and pressure and pressure until you the mighty master
pops them all in one fell swoop
And you can pop the ones stuck between the neckbones too
Like drowning passengers stuck between lifeboats.
They’re sucked onto the little boats by helping hands
that none of us
should marry
and why would we?
girls were soft squishy
balls of flesh
all finger and no nail
they spent their time
looping long thin hair
around their skinny digits
and they smiled
far too often

at seventeen i laughed
at myself
at the child i had been
i played and fought
and playfought
finding comfort
in the gentle game
i engaged in sorry
shameful things
to feel their skin
and see their teeth
and i wondered restlessly

Lend Me an Ear

I went and sat by the shores today
Out to see the waves
Attempt to ease up tensions built
My soul in disarray

Heaven won't bestow on me
The answers that I seek
Stars neglect in unison
Sky completely bleak

This does not surprise me
They weren't asked to fill this task
I just came to see the tumbling water
Clash on its own back

In search of my serenity
Beside an empting flask
Basking in solitude merrily
The waves won't let it last

Repeating of its sorrows
With each recurring splash
It spoke before I got here
Or anyone else at that

Describes in utter detail
Of all the nights so cold
Extracted tales from memory
To no one ever told

The waves have heard, and said much more
But never an ear in sight
""Fear not!"" A roar unleashed by me
Your streak ends here tonight

I came to dwell on my own mishaps
Perhaps a pain or two
Yet, my attention caught in stride
By your endless brood

I too never understood
Why times can be so harsh
Yet I know a weight has lifted
Off your burdened heart

You don't need an answer
Just someone to hear
I bet it's worth the trouble
Contesting through the years

For the moment you've recessed
Until I disappear
I'm sorry, but I must
In order to find

My

There's more to love than pain,
And I just had a cheeseburger
As this time comes again, my rage grows and burns hot
So I loudly proclaim: fuck Black Friday. A lot.
Fuck treating Thanksgiving as Black Friday eve
Fuck ""Screw the giving, it's time to receive!""
Fuck five AM sales, fuck midnight ones more
Fuck folks lining up outside the damned door
Fuck doorbuster sales, fuck earbusting ads
Fuck Christmas music, and fuck Christmas fads
Fuck reindeer, fuck Santa, fuck all gods of greed
Fuck spending a fortune on things you don't need
Fuck people who think that employees matter less
Than saving ten bucks on a fifty buck dress
Fuck ""More for me, guess it sucks to be you""
Fuck ""They should be grateful they have work to do""
Fuck ""It's a tradition we do it each fall""
Fuck ""Who cares about others, I'm buying them all!""
Fuck ""They chose to work there,"" fuck ""Why should I care?""
Fuck ""I got up early, so it's only fair""
Fuck 'savings,' fuck 'bargains,' and I'll make this a toast:
Because it closes doors
That should remain open
And throws a straight jacket
On the imagination.

These are things I say to her
When she’s here
Picking my brain, as she says,
And rummaging through my memories
And words
Like I’ve put a “rubbish sale” sign
On my apartment window.

I cant type when you stand behind me
I say
And turn to look at her
Admiring her eyes
And her hair
The way the corner of her mouth twitches
When she’s about to smile.

You look good, Ivy
I tell her
And cough into my hand

Stop smoking
She replies
And stick to your sobriety
You look like shit when you drink.

Some people aren’t happy
Unless someone is failing in misery
I tell her
Friends are that way.

She laughs
And continues rummaging…
I imagine the energy of all your years
Held a glass of orange juice
The first time a boy awkwardly put his arm
Around you,
All the tiny stories you will never consider
significant enough to share
all the tiny stories, that preceded this shoulder next to me
I trace a path of squiggly lines with my finger
Across every sunburn, and I feel every chlorinated
Swimming pool you graced
With the sublime contour from your neck
To your elbow, shifting the water and propelling you forward

And I move softly to your right shoulder
My index, middle, and ring finger
Drawing letters and lines gently, drafting a romance
just barely touching
While I imagine
The life this shoulder will know in the future
The beautiful garments that will fall upon it
The feelings it will inspire, at a glance, from anyone
So lucky to lay eyes on it
And maybe, I see myself there,
Beside it
And maybe, regretfully I consider
Myself away from it
And then I think of this shoulder, right now
My fingers caressing it, at this very moment,
my heart swelling by it
And your eyes
Closed, and you
softly breathing
But for one more with you
I’d slowly extract
Each vein from my body,
For just one more day with your hand in mine,
For one more kiss to make my sternum ache.
To hear your car pull up
And see you walk up the path
To see your smile
To make you smile
I thought you used to take my breath away,

Sideways glances and hopeful thoughts

In which you are focused solely on me.

There's a handful of abbreviated seconds

Where I think I've caught your eye and

Diverted your attention away from

Things far less mundane than myself.

Before each blink separates us again,

You communicate your want for clarity

And, perhaps most importantly, your need

To disconnect yourself from reality.

It is in this conflicting location

More than anywhere else that I wait

With anticipation as the minutes build up.

If you're looking for truth: I think I could



a pair of shoes on feet too large.





I sing when I do not know the lyrics,


speak when I do not remember the words.





I hurt like a bruised apple.


My smile is actually a grimace.





Stored in the locket round my neck


is all my pain and sorrow,





heavy enough that if I were to ever go swimming,


I would drop to the bottom like an anchor.





My pain and sorrow anchor me here.


Without it I would fly away like a birthday balloon.





When I lie on the ground and tilt my head back,


I fall into the sky like a seltzer in a glass of water.





I do not know my name,


not like the muscle that twitches in my eyelid,





not like the crooked nail on my left toe.


My name is just a bunch of letters,





but the mole between my pointer and index finger


reminds me that I am just a human.



I do not believe in God,


though not nothing is holier than blossoms in the spring.





I am nineteen years old and still wish I could fly.


I promise to jump out of the first plane I ever ride in.





If I could have a superpower,


it would be to go back in time to October 11th, 2008





to tear up those letters


and tell my parents how much I love them.





Every new tattoo is a desperate attempt to camouflage myself


from everything I have ever done.





I wish I were a cat.


I wish I were an eagle.





I wish I were a penguin in a sea lion's maw.







and it has quite an elegant flowetry

a learning you'll find quite, lickity

the name it shall be is limrickity

you rhyme line by line

and time after time


My heart of steel

My eyes of sand

My broken body, weary with tide

I drop and break this one last side

Frozen on this beach of life

A broken token of my strife

Hands of ice

Eyes of grain

My metal heart no one has claimed

But who would want me for I am this



And thanks for listening.

Misguided

barking at shadows



On the lawn: cast down from sun

yellow and

sick of living on


Sunshine and grass clippings of

summer gone

forever shadows


We will not live on your old

daylight or

sunsets anymore


So, are people reading and just not voting or commenting?






Some thoughts:





A drifter, a drinker, a life on the rocks
Two steel resolved revolvers just waiting to be shot

4 days after my birthday
My parents made a splitdecision
Based on superstition
That I should get a circumcision
The doctor sliced with precision
And made an incision
That caused a division
Between what God had blessed
And what was no longer required after a holy revision

Maybe I'm a bit of a sceptic
But isn't it a little barbaric
That a deity who has power over everything genetic
Creates something naturally unclean
Which requires local anasthetic
To be removed for reasons deemed cleric
By old text that is poetic, prophetic
Isn't that fucking pathetic?
Putting an infant through surgery deemed cosmetic
While proclaiming your stance as apologetic
And not feeling sympathetic

However. A greater source of vexation
is that when I vent my frustration
about the semicastration
of my modest perturbation
To a friend or relation
Instead of reacting to the tale of my operation
With a degree of condemnation
What occurs is the following situation
Like tuning a tv to get the static out of a dodgy station
Without the need of actual observation
They can now with their imagination
And this bit of unneeded information
Picture a more accurate illustration
A mental representation
A clearer visualisation
Clarification
Depictation


the west bank of the jordan

is fantastic real estate

location, location, location

religion, religion, religion

i’ve seen the ruins of my ancestors

and felt no compulsion to resettle



from a military perspective

it would be strategically foolish

to let anyone else live in those hills

but i feel no compulsion to resettle



we can’t let them into our country

because they keep trying to blow it fucking up

so meanwhile they live in squalor in purgatory in between phases of a nation

and i still feel no fucking compulsion to resettle



a child born blank into a world that writes

it’s problems all over his life

grows up to hate those that forced him to live this way

and i fucking hate the people that resettle


sworn to defend them

i stood on their fence

between homes of 2 people i’m told are too different to live on the same side


and all i can feel is weak that i’m not strong enough to change his world

mine’s great and i want to share.


i want him to listen to red hot chili peppers

unless he doesn’t like them

then he should listen to whatever he wants

i want him to see the beach but it’s on our side of the fence

unless he doesn’t like it then i want him to see what he wants

i want him to feel the same way about the privilege we have on this side

i want to tell him my favorite joke and hear his

i want to give him a piece of paper and see what he draws

and i want to tell him how much i love it.



i want to build him a lego palace for all his lego friends to live in




i want to give him buses to take him to the places he wants to go

i want to give him the tastiest food he can imagine (but healthy, no candy.)

i want to give him a talkboy pen so he can hear his own voice

i want to tell him he can be anything he wants to and mean it


Extracting this aborted thought from the womb in my head

It was originally conceived with good intentions
My motives were pure

But somewhere along the narrow passages of pink and gray
I gave up

And so
These thoughtless words were spat out
Into the dirty and uncaring arms of your ears

Only to be thrown away

ease your pretty little mind
for you are much too beautiful
to have thoughts of this kind.

Dreams mean more than nightmares;
It's dreams you're meant to keep.
That's why nightmares only happen
once you fall fast asleep.

Keep your chin up, lovely.
You'll swim while demons sink,
for you are so much stronger
than the demons, or you, think.

Stop the tears and bleeding,
for you can win this deadly fight.
Things will get better, I promise.

that's how we waste the hours

of our lives.

I tell myself

another night of this will be

the death of me

but I know that

doesn't matter.

This world appears

through a numb haze in

off shades of grey,

and you are the only

blotch of colour

I've seen for months.

So I take this tired body

and these dirty lungs

to endure another night

in this room

because when I wake up

at half past three

to see your figure next to me

I can finally breathe easy

and the future

doesn't seem so

black and white.

And doors to emotions I couldn’t feel

Sold in a currency I didn’t own

While a band on the corner played in a tune
That I couldn’t hear

It took me years to realize
I should probably find a new city to live in
like a surge of life
a phenomenon
and I dragged behind you
mindless
unnoticed
a mere mortal
in mixed company


you left
like mercy
a calamity
and I collect myself
changed
experienced
thankful that you stopped here





You are replaceable.

She has lived my life; she has seen what I have seen.

She has looked into my eyes, and entered my soul.

Her life mixed with mine, her love is my goal.


Who is this girl that now lives in my heart?

This is not my life, No this is only the start.

She takes control and makes me smile.

She is with me now, but only for a while.


Who is this girl? I don’t want her to go.

I love her now, doesn’t she know?

She is mine forever, with me she must reside.

To make a life of memories, and watch the changing of tides.


Who is this girl that kisses me so?

I would carry her across a mountain, high and low.

She is no longer my friend, she is so much more.

I kiss her in peace, and prepare for her lore.


Who is this girl that tells me her life?

She fought a battle, she ended her strife.

She loves me now, and I love her.

This is no longer a dream that was deferred.


Who is this girl that is in my dreams?

She has lived my life; she has seen what I have seen.

She has looked into my eyes, she entered my soul.

I have gained her love; her marriage is now my goal.



Maybe in the inbetween
our ghosts will live again.
Our souls entwine erotically
and then begin to spin,
around the stained illusions of distrust
and my panicked attempts to hold you in.
Maybe in the inbetween
our ghosts will live again.


Maybe in the inbetween
I'll taste your love again.
I'll worship our naked trembling skin
and slip quite slow,
from your gentle glow
and leave when I can't win.
Maybe in the inbetween
I'll taste your love again.


Maybe in the inbetween
when we've lost our wars of sin.
When the wine has turned to vinegar
and my eyes have become quite dim,
when your breasts are dry and wrinkled
and our love is paper thin.
Maybe in the inbetween
when we've lost our wars of sin

where the honey pot wide handles
are slight and sweet.
Here I'll kiss the turning world
beneath the night sheets
and lay my lips to the curve of pelvic valleys
running fingers to stars up Andromeda's waistalleys
My cheek upon the silk by the navel where dwell
the secrets of Eden by where all eating is well
and blessed by the scents in which bliss was first born
through the knowing of touches, between thighs and the thorn.
Running wild up the castle stair spineway to land
on the shoulders where muscles electrically band
the tight rope to your nape neon lighted in fur
and ravaging fingers seek hairs by the grasp
to be gripped and then guided tilting neck lines and chin
in angles for lovers like felled seraphim,
who bold and ferocious search love through their lust,
worship with tongues betwixt thighs, upon bust,
with lips swimming long collar bone streams,
til lost and aghast, where the deity dreams
a little death in your lips at last,
at last.



By N.N.
Lying on her bed the hours melted into air.
The steam of our breath became small dying ghosts.

She said it was an enigma.
Reaching for the light to pinch or squeeze it out.
She motioned with a fist closed to keep our voices down.

She told me I needed love.
Gasping for crisp air as my little white river flowed.
She kissed my mouth and tore the meat off my thin bones.

I ran all night to be free.
Six swans arranged neatly in water between the broken ice.





There was a childhood of sticky fingers and chocolates stolen

in the dark of night

and eaten in delicious forbidden fear

of being found,

and every day my grandmother

filled the house with the smell of hearty food

because it was the only way she knew how to say

“I love you, even though you’re messy and your hair is unbrushed”.

In the school lunchroom,

I was jealous of the kids with brown paper bags,

because I had clear tupperware with sandwiches

that had meat so spicy that you could smell it

all the way over on the other side of the room.

There was birthday cake that I only had to share with two other people,

even though I had invited twelve.

I swallowed gobs of sweet blue frosting that tasted so bitter.

There were the lollipops that stayed in a bowl

on the school psychologist’s little round table,

and as I answered questions like a vending machine,

giving out the answers I knew they wanted,

I stared at the lollipops and wondered if I could ask for one.

I never did, because I didn’t want them to think

that I needed anything from them.



I remember two different summer camps,

floating in the space between elementary school and high school.

For two weeks, one hot summer in Michigan,

I rode horses and swam in small ponds full of snapping turtles,

and I couldn’t speak the language of all the girls in my cabin,

because I had never learned how to speak

without a smartypants accent.

I hated all the food there,

so for two weeks, breakfast, lunch, and dinner,

all I had was peanut butter on wonder bread.

My mouth was too sticky to let me say

“Please, don’t hate me,

I just want to be friends,

I’m sorry that I’m not like you”.

After two weeks of peanut butter and silence,

my thighs had turned into wonder bread,

soft and squishy,

and I went home and never ate peanut butter again.




Two years later,

I went to fat camp in Pennsylvania,

and some sadistic bastard had put a camp

full of girls with extra chins and heavy breath,

right next to a chocolate factory.

.........................................................REALLY??!!

When the skinny, pretty councilors

woke me up at 5:30 in the morning

so that I could run for two miles,

the smell of chocolate hung in the air

as heavily as the mist,

and with every sweaty pant

I expelled while running around an endless track

and gasping to keep up with yet another group of girls who rejected me,

I could taste nothing but sweet desire,

and I would run harder, hoping

that if I could lose as much of myself as possible,

I would stop wanting,

wanting to eat,

wanting to be wanted, wanting to be beautiful.

But no matter how much I ran,

I never managed to lose even a bit of myself,

in pounds or in thoughts.




Now I have a restofmylifehood

of thinking of carbs and calories and sodium and trans fats,

and  the jiggly bits of my thighs and arms and stomach,

of eating vegetables and ignoring bread,

of avoiding eating in public because there’s a different kind of fear now,

of hating food, of hating eating, of hating the fact

that I cannot photosynthesize,

that no matter how far I stretch upwards toward the sun,

no matter if I can taste the wind across my skin,

I will never become a tree,

I will never be able to live off of air and sunlight,

I will never not be trapped in this useless body.

I have learned what it means to be hungry.



My tail's tucked inbetween
my legs and
this feeling is new to me.

I've never been good at
being a man or
being myself or
doing things right or
even apologizing.


The phrase
""I'm sorry""
has been uttered from my lips
so many times that
it means

nothing


anymore.



But I want to
do right.
I want to
apologize for
everything.
For not
being the man I should be.
For not
being a person people like.
For not
treating you like the royalty you are.


But, I fear
it's too late
for these words,
both
literally
and
metaphorically.


Forgive me, for
in the morning I shall
not be the man
I was. I shall
instead
be the man
who I see in the mirror
after
a shower.





Cold.





Cynical.



Stressed.











Alone.











Not every
change is
They speak to me of tragedy,
and I feel as though it's past.
And the words I hear
are nothing more
than the lamentations of those
that went before.

Perhaps the tragedy broke them.
Perhaps they are simply ghosts,
unwilling to live

and who you've been

tactile response

breaking open your doors

to shift the scene

to find out where the safest place is

to listen to the rumblings of your insides

to hear the thumping of your hidden heart

so i am here, my darling,

i am here to press my ears against

everything you have ever been

and all that you will be

remember when we spiraled

and the life we found when we expected death?

when your tears crisscrossed mine

i read my words

and your body and my body

became transmission

signals sent that we partially understood

and fully accepted

My head implodes from a mental fatality.
I sung an O.D. to joy in the cracks of my head;
Fifteen times the dosage, I should really be dead.
Hypnopompic hallucinations harrow the line,
Between fauxgenius and insanity, abated in time.
The misnomer of a healthy mind, belligerent in ways;
Denatured and desensitized from being up for days.
Lost in a labyrinth as thoughts begin to birl;
Cascading cocktails of emotion, as the universe unfurls.
Watch the sun through algid eyes, the air around is stale;
""You'll be fine, it's in your mind, here's the holy grail"".
Oxy generates a calm, Temaze to chill me out;
No adverse affects around except a vulgar shout.
""FUCK YOU!"" At the top of my lungs as some whore,
Tries to stop me beating my fists on the floor.
Can't walk, can't think, can't see anymore;
Blocking out horrific memories of brutality and gore.
My psychotic secrets are a personal shame;
There's no one around but my dead self to blame.
The big bang of my mind came six hours in;
I'm returning to normal, safe in my own skin.
In a world so detached that I'm taken aback;




I lean back in my chair and breathe deep, closing my eyes.


That email is not mine, that phone call can be answered by someone else.


I don't write as often these days, but I still create.


Be funny, make music, relax.




Two birds fight
over a cicada bug
screaming. Little


brown backed birds,
chests: cream, puffed;
living like leaves


scattering
on their own
wind, skittering


from the sidewalk
and back again to glean
crumbs from cracks,


bathe in patches,
in divots, of sky

A bashful smile escapes her.

She hides it in the shadow

of her silky hair's fortress.

Chasing after my prize,

I tickle her side.

We roll together

and become enmeshed.

A giggle, a cackle

she now turns to face me.

Her smile is wide on display.

A thief in broad daylight,

I steal my way into the fortress

rightfully deserving a kiss.
besides cycles of falls and rises?
The memories made from times the mind must
and did we things of record.
Loop a repeat,
or path's end?
Our find to need,
we search.
We need to find
our end paths,
or repeat a
loop  record of things we did
and must mind the times from made memories;
the rises and falls of cycles

I used to say,

“he’s gonna be the death of me”.

The tiniest kid, brown eyes like warmth, teeth everywhere

except where they should be.

Always at my side,

he was the reason for more silent counttotens than

even my own brothers.

He pouted, he whined, he shrieked, he sreamed.

He threw shoes, he punched walls,

he lept into my heart.

He was the silent ache in the back of my brain

and the gentle light I behind my eyes.

Elijah sat next to me all afternoon one rainy day,

nothing unusual.

The big ship came in, and

My heart filled with love


who’d been at sea for eternities.

Elijah was jumpy and glancing.

We both knew, and

Worn wearily
Played differently
At every opportunity



Short one about a girl I know



I've walked on the outskirts
I've peered into the walls
I've seen the city of angels
I've seen a glimpse of you





I pictured him there: hanging out,
rope moaning like his mother,
the windy city making
forcing  him to be blown
back and forth, ultimately alone.

I saw him bathing
in a tub of deepest red
wine, the drunkenness creating in him
sad and lonely desperation.
The wine dripped down, offering lonely libation.

They gathered all us students into a small chapel,
100 jerks, jerking off
masturbating to the saints of our own self pity,
stroking our own egos as we said:
""Light will drive out darkness, oh
he who drives it out is blessed!""
(But, really, none of us were depressed.)

Pitifully, we pondered life's meaning
from inside stone walls. I heard his
maddening, insane screaming
rattling inside my head
dead! He was dead.

Mike said he had jumped
in front of the L, his brain
splashing out onto a sea of unsuspecting passerby's,
their lives touched by his
most intimate place, a sanctuary of inner secrets
shattered.

I pictured him sitting in a cafeteria chair
with hair as big as God's
is in all those old pictures.
""Mitch"", he'd say to me, already half asleep,
the school day being half over.
""It's not about how fast you move,
or how much money you have to lose.""
He'd pause to take a bite of whatever
monstrous feast he'd bought in line, taking forever.
""No, it's really about  having a good time,
about making sure your friends are as good as mine.""

I pictured him lying to us,
lying down face first in the dust.
Where most of us were small,
(waist size, hair, personality, intellect)
he was huge, grand and tall.

250lbs, 5'10"",
a giant life, never lived, never to be made again.

As tears hit the page, all
things are laid to rest,
even the best of us


just to hear you say


to keep a look out
for you
in case you'd been lost
to the night.
But it stared me down
stern faced and somber
as if to say,
""Let this one go.""

So I called out to Mars
a little more angry
than sobriety allows.
But he stood by dumbly,
idly.

And thereabout a month or so out,
I looked up towards Venus
all bright and blue in the sky.
I almost saw you there
beside me, looking up,
asking,
""What now?""

The stars are up in heaven
and I am down below
and all is right
When it’s finished
I’ll call it “surrender”
And deliver it to you
In your apartment
On the hill.

You’ll serve me wine
And laugh your nervous laugh

I’ll look at your legs
And try to talk seriously

You should let me move in here
I’ll say
Take care of me, feed me
The future royalties of everything I write here
Will be yours.

You’ll laugh
And cover your mouth
Then the painter will show up
With his books
And ideas
And you’ll keep laughing
Telling me to come back later
And to leave the wine glass there.

I’ll go back home
To my own wine
To my words
The thoughts of finally bedding you
Buzzing about the room
Like the mosquitoes I cant kill.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy them! Thanks, and much love!

and set my mind afire
he speaks through prim and proper prose
in whispy grey attire


the smokey man has filled my ear
with words of fume and haze
his voice is all I seem to hear
beneath this warm malaise

the smokey man has filled my shoes
as we prowl the city streets
the smile he wears is but a ruse
purposed to snare those whom he meets

naught happened i did not allow
twas mine own hand that sealed my fate
from whence i came seems so distant now
I pray it's not too late

To the other side of town

And look for god in the alleys

In the dumpsters, in the trash

Dance around broken bottles

In the dead moon streets

A war dance for the city

Kid

I'll put red in my hair

And whoop to the night

Like songs for Hiroshima

Full of terror, full of dreams

And when the dying dusk settles

We can run through the park

With our flashlights

Spraying shadows, sending demons

Into the sleepless hours

Hanging like a fever, like the touch

Of Summer's musk

Over our abstract medium

Our concrete jungle

Like faraway lands with craters

Scorched earth and barren fields

Places with your father's bones

Where death followed them underground

Where secret wars were raged by secret men

Paranoid men

They were not crooks

They made those boys into men

We had our own ceremony

We smashed our bottles and performed

Our dance

We are men, not boys

It has been so long!
To be honest, though,
I haven't missed you.

With your icy fingers wrapped
Around the skinny neck of the Year,
You spell out
""The End""
In shiny Christmas tinsel
On every snowy rooftop.
With mirth and cheer
You proclaim an to end that all was good,
And squeeze the joy from everyone.

You bring fat men in sleighs
Who call me a
Ho, Ho, Hopeless
Wreck.
Your deathrattle sounds with
The sounding of party favors
And the bitter ending
Of Twelve months of sweat and tears and joy
Is set to the cheers of millions
Down in Times Square.

'Tis the season to be jolly,
So fuck off, December.
I'm sick of snowmen and cold sheets.
Go ruin someone else's month,
Because I won't let that happen to me,
into the truckstop garbage,
yawning, I rocked like a cradle.

I was younger, motorconfused,
barely able to distinguish
My left from my right.

The bricks smelled like urine
and I begged for cold soda,
I craved the quick energy.

You dug, like a skunk, Hellbent,
the holes in the trash were
just big enough for your hands.

The Ford Explorer sat quiet
against the violent wind, passing
lights crashing there like waves.

You understood, I saw in your
nodding jaw, your bright face
when you held the loud keys.

It left me once, this cold memory,
and I dug through the dirt to find it.



Contains cursing.

Lemme know what you think!








by Charles Bukowski

they don’t make it
the beautiful die in flame –
suicide pills, rat poison, rope, what
ever…
they rip their arms off,
throw themselves out of windows,
they pull their eyes from the sockets,
reject love
reject hate
reject, reject.

they don’t make it
the beautiful can’t endure,
they are the butterflies
they are the doves
they are the sparrows,

her petals shocked in their pinkrose perfection.
Is that their dress or are these roses clothed?
I couldn't tell their blush is their complexion.
I find the fair rose dull the strange intriguing,
though no rose knows their color has no meaning.

Whether this day brings heat or fright

My love couldn’t stop his flight,

I am naught.


Now, I plead to be something, or nothing:

“Give me a heart that my mind can control

Or take it all: my will, life, and soul.”

Save for peace in life or death,

I care not.


But don’t worry, my heartbreaker, God rids you of guilt

Of the seeds you spilled that caused me pain.

If life brings no peace again

Death will, I know.



EDIT: It is Central Daylight Time here so it is currently 6 hours to midnight.





And tacitly, it flew away.

Get off the wall, she told the Pigeon.

It trilled once and made its way.

Get off the wall, she told the Cat.

It cantered off in soft dismay.

Get off the wall, she told the Sunlight,

and it sorely left its day.

Get off the wall, she told the Boy,

but his head did slowy sway.

For he loved the view up there,

and climbed there everyday.

And no lone person could take him

from his dreams of endless play.

And the stars, they shine so bright
And the world so still and solemn
That the devil sings at night.

Ten million waiting for a cue,


Now they march on and on,
Together they chant, together they stand
""Sign this petition, one click away!
Be an individual, we say!""


United by uniform,
A tribute to their roots,
Fawkes's face
Torn designer jeans,
A trimfit Che shirt
And a great girth to boot.


Massproduced and nolonger taboo,
The modern guerrilla hero
Brought back to zero.
Come together, irksome fools!
Dance with me! Come fullcircle!

Ducdame!

Ducdame!

Ducdame!


Ten million waiting in a queue
Looming and all in tune
""Come in soon, come consume
My anticonsumerism.""


In unison and without schism
The largest of target markets
Baskets it's umpteenth casket


And so we parade to our graves
And as we sing loud, as we dance around
A pained, Beat echo howls in the background

...Ducdame...

...Ducdame...

...Ducdame...
and you want me to climb
to the top
so that we can share the
sight of the lights
of our sleeping city
below.

But I am too afraid to climb,
even for you.

At the top of this steeple,
on this romantic night,
love will not be in the air.

Only fear will be.

Not the fear of heights,
but the fear that
I might
decide to
jump.



Are you like me? Always

searching for what the answer

is to your own life? We all

have questions. Always leading

back to the root of all

questions…but who has time to

question anymore? Are you

like me? So lost that you

need to search your own

photo albums, or your

online profiles to know

what you like, what activity

tickles your fancy.

Are you like me? Too

Lost, to be given a rope

Cast out to you by

The manifestation of

Purpose.

In a woman.

In a man.

In a sense, are we the same?

Every breath that gives

One life, will exhale

With poison and kill

Every cut we make deep

Healed by a lowly pen.

So alone, we relate to

The only people who

Can’t relate back,

In our stories, in our

Books, movies, music.

Are you like me? Smile

To all, greet each embraced

walk home alone

Sit quiet on a chair

While the world revolves

Around us

Are,
My dad?
Who are you?
I've never met you.
I know your name but not your face.
Besides that mug shot.
I’ll make sure
my kids
know

A small pale untruth

Trips off the lips

And slips out with ease

No pause or freeze;

Floating by, innocent lies



Questions arise

Lies grow cream, with that egg shell sheen

Sickly tinges of green

Ornamented

Embellished




Spiralling down through shades of brown

Not so clever now

Take a bow




Raise the bar

In too far, spewing tar of darkest black

The weight will break your back

Green eyes and a bulging sack of technicolour lies
while I’m open all the same.
Rushed into a world of girls, pearls, diamonds,
and putting trust in sons of Cain.
My abilities are of forgotten ones
The overlooked, the outstanding in his field
plowshare in wake but hands full of diseased grains.
You see the weak,
as unable
and last week,
was her birthday.
So forgive my sin of making wishes
before she takes the cake.
Cold as ice yet vivid in our younger years
painted perfect pictures but who’s to blame?
Moth, or flame, she takes the bait
and her jewelry clangs out new cadence to life.
You feel her pain?
The lack of understanding
but yes I’m here, in stuck demanding
a small token of what it means to be a man
and deem myself worthy of girls so entranced.
We got matching tattoos.
Her’s says Do,
Mine says Die,
But nothing’s permanent, the ink fades, and leaves me
Why am I stuck in a world wearing these contradictions
a hope to ask what’s on my mind:
Because there’s nothing. I’ve yet to decide.
You did and said it’s real only to end in a night.
So fuck you, blasted blaring music on the ride.
With a spark.  I could be crouching
In the cab of a oneseat delivery truck.
I could be leaning on the dash, the cold
Coming off my shoulders, cascading.
Once it was 4:00 a.m., a parking lot,
December, 1985, February, a street corner,
Connecticut.  I could feel it strong
As my boss did what he knew how
With a broken coin box.  He spun the ratchet
Like a pinwheel, his eyes on the horizon.
With bolt cutters, he broke the night open,
Left me electric with a low sparkle,
The sense of someone watching me.


For weeks I studied an ancient woman
Forgotten in the back of a shop.
She sat on a chair too small,
Drawing secrets from Japanese slippers
With a long curved needle of bone.
As the needle came around, so did I,
Pulled into her craft.  Her pierce crackled
The clear glaze of the morning.  The alignment,
Her polarity, sent ions coursing my way.
They called and I wanted to go,
to swim upstream, to taste the source.


Last night, waiting without a proper jack,
I wondered what else was missing.
I didn’t even know its name.
The mechanic came in a thin gray coat.
He used a footlong flathead to pry
Off the hubcap, a brace under the wheel,
A tire iron to loose the lugs.
The pneumatic wrench he fired up
Was exciting to consider, but it was
The torque wrench that released the energy.
He checked each lug three times, once
For his mother, once for his gods,
Once for the wrong names they’d been given.
I felt forces gathering.  They sang louder
With each footpound applied.
I felt the guardians of his craft
Tug on my earlobe, saw their heads
Nod to the skill of those sure hands,
Felt on my skin their low crackle pull.
There are so many things I don’t know.
Wild guesses will have to be my bedrock.
To start, I will be standing in rainstorms,
Wrapped in copper coil, my hands held high.

She wouldn’t let them fault the
intentions she had inside.

Although she doesn’t appear to care
for those who did her wrong –
her strength was merely outwards
and her heart was in her song.

While some just have colored with thrown ink.
Some, giving their trust have drenched it complete,

While some, their own, soothing verdant.

They had compassion on it, and taking it up,

Crumbs fell through.
They gave me cake

No crop so furtive,
no coat as pale,
to cook with such sweet apples
set with the effort of his task
I almost wished I could fly, to relieve him
of the burden of me.
When he caught my not so polite stare,
he simply remarked:

“There is nothing quite so ponderous
as a sphere.
And it takes some amount of shifting before it settles
between my shoulder blades.
But after so many ages and eons, I have
become accustomed to such a worldly albatross and
the sprawling sands of the Sahara
no longer scrape the tender flesh from my back.
I suppose, compared to my brothers
My punishment is not so harsh.
Because if I’ve learned one thing here,
supporting this terra cotta planet it is
that I am not so big but rather,
the Earth is very small.”

It was at this moment that
I began to envy grains of sand,

for fear of the unknown,

and for fear of not truly knowing ourselves.




This fear is fallacious,

for you must find yourself by relentlessly absorbing the vast colorful world,

and reckoning the means in which it delineates your humanity.





One is never truly found,

until the day their heart stops beating,

only then are we a complete and totally discovered being.




Never shield your heart nor your eyes,

as you might miss something momentous.



I find untouched parts of myself in you.

You find untouched parts of yourself in me,

together we flourish.



Fuck you.

Fuck you cancer,
fuck the pain you bring
fuck the families you destroy
fuck the burns
fuck the cuts
fuck vomiting
fuck incessant needles.
fuck muscles twitching in long hours of the night
fuck muscles,
wasted away from disuse
fuck uncertainty
fuck hopelessness
fuck long hours of poison
fuck pale skin bared by loss of hair
fuck the light you took from his eyes
fuck the doubt you put in hers
fuck the futures you rape and burn
fuck the pasts you steal away, cell by cell
fuck the dreams you hold,
bloody and beaten before you
fuck the innocence you lay waste
fuck wellmeaning comments that can do nothing
words whispered to an empty sky
fuck pity
fuck the looks that say “i’m glad i’m not you”
fuck you, that I have to find silverlinings
fuck you, that my children know what metastases are,
that they know what chemo is
fuck you, that his children won’t know him,
that she can no longer have them
fuck your yellow bracelets
fuck your endless waves of pink
fuck your rainbow of ribbons
crying for complacent attention
fuck your wigs
fuck the scars you adorn us with
fuck your handkerchiefs wrapped round heads
fuck the myriad of little indignities you bring with you
fuck your insatiable, cruel, and mindless hunger,
that consumes,
and consumes,
and consumes.

for all those lost





Morning wood makes me
long for the arms which once held
The blades clean dirt from my sole

Walking alone in this strange forgotten place

I remember the habits we outgrew

But you were running at a faster pace

To a life that was closer to the sun

Brightness shone on you just like a spotlight

And I was just a background to your fun

On our last day, you were no more my knight

The suburbs started to change around us

Slowly they molded you into the worst

Of our memories some began to rust

Poems you wrote to me sounded rehearsed

I realized we did not walk away

Cars dissolve with daylight.

Clouds retreat
Curiously,
Clusters of the stars
Concede: ""Hey! Be grateful;

You exist.""


""Sir, I exist!""

""However,"" replied the universe,

""The fact has not created in me

A sense of obligation.""

I don't know any of these people.

Why did I wear shorts?

This guy looks janky but his acid is cheap.

Five strychnine sugar cubes.

and now none.

They say it's the anticipation that kills you.

I wonder if you die before you hit the ground.

This cigarette tastes funny.


Maybe I should be alone.

Do I look like an asshole sitting here with my eyes closed?

No, I probably just look like i'm on drugs.

wasn't I smoking a cigarette?

I am the universe experiencing itself.

A paradox asks me if I want to know secrets.

There are werewolves in these woods.

If I don't pee quick enough they will get me.

I am a werewolf.

My friends are probably worried about me.

I change back into a human.

I guess that means they took a hug.

Sounds like you need a haiku,

but I liked the way
they wrapped around
her weathered skin
and split it into different hemispheres.


I liked the way
her mother looked
when they put on
her favorite red lipstick
as the color drained from her face
into a space I couldn't touch.


I enjoyed the thought of you
at your kitchen table:
wearing your toothless smile
and constructing landscapes
that you'd never seen
with little cardboard pieces.


I liked the way her father
always called me by his wife's old name
and loved me even though he
did not remember me,
and that he yelled at fires
that were never there.

I walked away

I burnt us to the ground

and salted the earth

for good measure.

I did it gladly

and with mirth

and it brings me a smile to know

you haven’t moved on...

the way your scent lingers on my pillow

or will rise from the shower

with the steam.

You really should get over me, dear

it isn’t healthy to keep coming back

every morning when I awake

to find I’ve set out two cups...

Surely the neighbors will talk,

if you keep lurking in

the corners of my flat

wasting your time pining

for what is no longer yours,

leaving little hints

that remind me I once loved you.

I think it’s time you stopped.


I have wandered far beyond her spectral sight

and never once counted myself as lost


I’ve found myself beneath that selfsame light;

where the hours and the minutes meet

shuttered thinly from that shaded passing slight


an edict not in vain or of conceit

but flushed with quiet disdain for those contrite

and wise enough to see the day’s deceit


That would herself proclaim man’s one birthright.

Oh yes, Mr. Frost,

split in two, a red sash down your speckled white skin.
You are an animal now, not a child; a frog or a cow's eye,
dead and dissected.

They put a new heart in your chest but leave the knives inside,
so a ghost haunts your stitches and whispers when you sleep.
They tell you that you're going to be okay, like a frog or a cow's eye
or a broken child really knows how to be okay.

You turn the holes in the ceiling into black stars,
scratch your name into the constellations so they will
always be scarred with your memory, just in case they pull you back open
and you forget what you are.

They prop you against a pillow and you sink into it.
They put books in your hands, use your fingers to turn the pages
of someone else's story; pictures and words to remind you
that you have no chance, that you will never have a chance.

At night the stars go dark and hushed voices erupt
from the crack in the abyss, arguing about you, about money.
(Like home.) Something sings in a low, soft, child's whisper
and all the noise and warmth subsides.

I love you, I love you, it says, I love you,
words pouring like electricity through your healing scars.
The little knives in your heart stir harder, scraping against your insides,
wrong cubicle
on the way back from the bathroom

I might make a new friend

Is the rumor repeated most often.

Kayla and I, by the truth of the day

Were “special” best friends.

You know, like… gay.

And this rumor persisted

It tangled

It twisted

Through 8th grade, through boyfriends,

Through football games and weekends,

Until a bump blossomed on her 13yearold frame

And the rumor of our secret affair had to change.

Are you the father? They’d ask,

In smiles dripping with sarcasm

Droplets I’d catch

With a laugh,

I wish.

I wish, that the person

Who fathered that child

Could be the one who holds you tight when you’re crying.

I wish, that the lips

That shush your fears away

Were the same lips that get to kiss yours every day.

He should carry your books

While you carry his child

Instead I’m holding your hair

As the pancake bile

Of that morning’s breakfast

Makes an entrance, unexpected

In 4th period history.

I know you’d do the same for me.

So we’ll keep fighting

And we’ll keep winning

‘Til we can give this baby a fresh beginning;

Born out of the hallway battlefields

Of middle school

Into a cradle of love

certain paths without intention.
Not every star is circumpolar,
providing of a way home.

Change is truth, change is
the only consistency in a universe
of constant motion,
in which things enter and exit
through infinite progression.

In my heart,
there was the destruction of
a fluorescent dream,
illuminated with the greatest simple sincerity.
The dream is now a mere fallacy,
and so it became false emotionality.

In your heart,
there are chambers of blood
and nothing else.

...I now realize there are better things to be had.





There’s a cup of coffee. It used to be a barista. It

Used to be a place to write bad poems. But today

It’s a cup of coffee. This morning I put on a pot

For the wife, and she took it all with her. I could

Make another. But out there, under the drizzle

That’s drizzled for 18 months straight, there’s a cup.

Bitter, add milk. Frothy, add sugar. Sweet, add biscotti.

In a fountain, at attention, looking backward
In a bowl of water wishes with a blue songbird
On his shoulder who keeps singing over everything:

Everything means nothing to me.

I picked up the song and found my picture
In the paper. The reflection in the water showed
An iron man still trying to salute people
From a time when he was everything he's supposed to be.


IS THE BEST MOTHERFUCKING

HAIKU EVER TOLD




THIS PSYCHIC HAIKU

KNOWS THAT YOU WILL COUNT THESE OUT

UPON YOUR LEFT HAND


Just who and where it was
And in my sleep it made a break
To try and leave my mouth
So it pushed
and pushed
and pushed
Till one by one
My teeth fell out
but then it learned
those teeth weren't bars
The moment I cease in time

Oft those beloved are compared to one
Red rose pluck’d or cooing of a dove
But I compare thee to the noonday sun
That is how I choose to express my love

The noonday sun shines brightly in the sky
Its golden beams doth catch all of this earth
Its warmth invigorates us for the night
Its guiding light shows us what we are worth

The noonday sun is like a work of art
My mother too, and loved with all my heart.

and fifteen of me
entered a room,
met up and paired off,
and commenced talking
each saying different things
I wonder how many
if any
would appreciate
the others company,
and how many
among the 'we's
would think the other

Eeping, seeping through my mind

The devil I thought I left behind,


It crawls around throughout the night

Looking for the only light

The light to bleed it out

See and just to figure out


Why this devil is within

And why dear God, it’s called a sin,


A sin to sit and wait and

Think of things that make

most people shrink

Shrink behind their wooden desk

In fear of looking at the breast,

And skin, and the body

From within,

It is a mortal thing that corrupts

All this life begins with lust,

A lust of life and fruit so red,

That it comes with what is said

From the man behind the stand,

But I know his mask is thin

And I see the sins he holds,

Hiding in his own skin folds

Oh his sins and how they seep,

But he brings the folks to weep,

But he won’t know what’s in store,

For him behind the Golden door.

The pearly gates to judge

With the man from up above,

But the mind can’t take these things,

So I bid adieu and take my leap.

Who had triplets,

Name Nit, Nat, and Tat.

It was fun in the breeding,

but hell in the feeding,


'It's a dandelion, and...'

She


There's a story here, and I won't tell it




She hesitated

'We are all dandelions

Leaving part of ourselves

Everywhere we go, and...'

She trailed off, bouncing in the wind

I am not to be trusted with

Stories ink have written


There's a story here, and I can't tell it

I smiled

Told her it was pretty

She...

Didn't buy it

That little wave that says

'Thanks, but no Thanks'

My smirk had betrayed me

There's a story here, and I'm trying to tell it

I left

Knowing less, wanting more

'Skin Deep' given new meaning

Funny she guarded only the exposed


hollow be thy name.
Thy kingdom came of man’s design.
Thy will formed by the same.
Of earth came dreams of heaven
give hope or daily dread,
and forgive you for your trespasses
as we sculpt words unsaid,
and lead us from our own  free will,
by telling us we’re evil.
For we are the kingdom,
have been the power,
and forever we’re bedeviled.

Ah men!

Today is grey, as the skies are filled, of clouds without silver lining.

The fog extends, transcends, then ends, where the lightblonde sun is shining.

If only the grey, inside of me, would end just as abruptly,

Or if the grey in man, which forces his hand, to feast and rule corruptly,

I’d picnic there, and only stare, at the cruel dark clouds behind me.

And I’d invite all of you, the animals too, to rest under Eden’s fig tree.

But it does not end, instead black and white blend, in harmonic coexistence.


I used to have that sad long stare in the mirror,
Looking straight into my eyes,
Trying to find that part of me that I know is pure,
Pathetic right? Then why do you always go back to it,
When you're alone in that bathroom at the bar,
The party, Whichever place you choose to waste yourself in,
Yeah, I used to be like you,
Wondering which friends were the real ones,
Feeling like a lone wolf in a sea of people,
Playing the character you portray in the world,
You know what I mean,
The great pretender, your alter ego,
Yeah, That's right, I can see through you,
Nobody really knows who you are,
Yeah, I used to be like you,
You say the times are tough,
You blame it on everything but your lack of effort,
You don't know anything about hardship yet,
You just can't wait for it to fall into place,
Your dreams aren't just visions of yourself in the future,
They are going to happen man, you say, just you wait,
Yeah, I used to be like you,
You convince your broken wallet you have scraps enough of
money,
You do the maths in your head and buy whatever drugs you  can find,
You take them and share them,
For that night you can only talk about yourself,
Such a shame the conversation is only in your head,
And that wallet? What happened, where did the money go,
That I so carefully calculated the hours before,
Yeah I used to be like you,
Smoking that cigarette to yourself in the cold wet air,
Making more broken promises with the universe,
Remembering what deals you still haven't kept,
Those few, sad, slow, tokes, feeling unsatisfied at yourself,
You disgust yourself, You light up another cigarette,
Smoke on, smoke is your friend right?
Yeah,
Yeah I used to be like you,
You know what?

A fleeting gift I did bestow


For how long I did not know


The end unseen but assured


Thoughts transfixed quite disturbed



Was this bounty but a lesson

Or could it truly be a blessing

Existence firm or apparition

Brought about by my volition



Interrogation of the source

Wanting proof of the course

Analysis overload

Seeds of doubt have been sowed



Expiration coming quickly

Brought about by thoughts quite sickly

Placing answers where there are none

Begins the setting of the sun



Conclusions drawn most in error

Giving rise to certain failure

Do not question what you see

It can vanish in  certainty



Love the time your gift is here

Hold it close and keep it dear

Appreciate the time you have

But the desire of hope doesn't

as if the man himself was guarding it.

“Remember me!” he says, and so I do,

Is it soft or is it hard?
How much do you need?
A ton or just a shard?



Tell me how to make it
What all does it take?
Please make sure the recipe is true
All the love I've known was fake



Then how do I use it?
Do I melt it and inject it?
Should I smoke it or crush it up?
Tell me how to perfect it.



I want to leave this reality
Or maybe just a part thereof
Baby I don't just want a buzz
I want to get high on your love

Though it looked much like my own

When I wore this mask I assumed its tastes

Its passions greater than I'd known

The mask consumed me, and had me do its bidding

For it, I laid with men, stole jewels and pondered playful killing

The mask is not me

Though I wear it often now

It has begun to fit more comfortably

But it's not me, I cling to that vow

The mask and I set out each night, looking for trouble and sin

I even wear it during the day now, the mask has developed a grin

""This isn't me,"" I thought, close to a month ago

This monstrous mask morphs me I screamed

But the mask assured me this wasn't so

The mirror says there is no mask

But my mind seems to disagree

I find it impossible now to perform any task

Without the mask interrupting me.

The past has faded from my mind now

All I remember's the shroud

Was there ever a me without the mask?

I suppose there was, I wonder what he was like.

As I near the end of my life, I long to remember my old face,

So I remove the mask and there is nothing but bone left in its place.

If there was never a mask, was there ever a me?

Have I ever met anyone? Or is it just masks that I see?



Who yearn only to be seen,


To cornered rooms through passage ways

Shines light through front door screens,


And darker moons make darker rooms

'till streetlights disturb our sleep,


From candlelight to wildfires

We dance like coals beneath our feet,


And houshold sounds creep overhead

We hear music down the street,


Danger knows the rowdy ones

Who only chase their dreams,


Spinning wheels past city signs

Together living's cheap,


From wallflowers to wildflowers


As currents pass the egret's stare

In dark grey days and frigid nights

When summer's passed and autumn dies

The river sounds are drowned a breeze

Howling through its bare bone trees

And all of life seems dead and bare

But there remains the egret's stare.

leaning into it.

Lost in a fall,
lost, then caught in a rise.

Down,
up

Air out,
air in.

Breathe out,
breathe in.

Soap bubble, caught on breath,
a life caught
in movie frames
scattered across
the bubble's curves.

That other boy, doppelgänger,
31 years preparing,

lean armed
sepia toned, fish pole on his shoulder,
nervous and earnest,
those black frames
cusping those gentle eyes,
fading now, into the distance.

Now, you
earnest young professor, you old black and white,
you leaver,
your pipe in teeth.

Mary.
Oh, Mary.
She is in Africa,
She is in Malaysia.
She is looking for your breath.

Your children. Those girls.
That boy.

Sawdust.

Leaves, woods.

Soap bubbles that fall.

Needham, Eastham,
Misty on the beach.

It sounded like air.
It sounded like bubbles breaking.

Breathe out
breathe in

Breathe in,
breath out.

Chest fall.

Chest fall.

Chest fall.

I do not know where to begin.
All those breaking pictures,
lost on broken bubbles.

Kiss me again.

wasting time
with you.
For the moments
when your breath is my breath.
When your eyes are molten,
Liquid light.
For the moments
when my everpresent asphyxiation
ceases,
and I breathe you.
In the silences,
your eyes catch mine
and exude life.
Yet
they consume me
with caressing flames.
I melt.
but only got feathers and broken white shells.
we stuck to the left,
followed the trail
of tiny flowers
that I tried to describe to you,
because I knew yellow was still new.

""they look like a kiss on your forehead feels,"" demonstrating.
""how reassuring,"" you said, blushing red.

and now, at the base
of the tallest cedar in the forest
I feel like that statue
that wept blood,
looking up, worshipping.
we both have eyes fused
to the heavens, playing at praying,
but her face is stained
crimson and, just now,
mine washes clean.

""red was a good first color,"" I had told you earlier,
and I still believed it, even though
no one else would trust your sight.

later that night, our eyes finally closed,
a flying tree
with gnarled roots dangling hundreds of feet, tickled the ground.
through owl holes
we saw into the hollow again,
glimpses of liquid gold pouring out
we swam through honey
with cedar boughs attached to our arms.

Working, drinking, thinking

of a life I wish to see.

I say to myself ""all will be okay,""

but routine is hell;

I am not a human

but a man within a shell.

I am born in a land

based on nine till five,

feeling satisfied, but never alive.

Wake up, stare at a screen,

speak to people day by day

and tell them what they tell me

how it seems.

Sit and listen how they must define


plugged the hole in me,

I am from a place that threw its tenants in the street.

There is nothing here to see,

imagination's died on me, yes; perhaps

it ceased to beor simply never was.

I am in between the lines of laughter

and of age, and every time one of those lines

appears so, on my face, I'm led to wonder

if it's one, or if the brother is to blame

and as the years stack up, and up, the latter

one remains.

I had a love once, to my name, that justified the world.

Purpose granted in the visage of ""oncelonelygirl.""

But, love is cold when lovers hearts shift from

one entity, into the cold equation of

both ""he"" and ""she.""

And when the variables don't add up,

you're left with misery.
The LCD shines bright,
but those words are all I see within the mess on the screen.
Shining with more darkness than light, they illuminate the night.




""I don't love you.""
Those two words I saw have morphed into four
And those four again divide; ""You're worthless.""
They burn with fire, but I shiver to the core.




""Love is watching someone die.""
They say. But you're not listening
And I'm dying, but you're not watching.
And the river runs freely, fresh red glistening.



""I love you.""
I've said, but you don't want to hear.
You know it kills me when you're silent,
But killing me is what you do best, dear.

at a blank page
points for diction, syntax
and message
none for grandiloquence
even skeptical
when people walk up to me
and smile
sometimes they even compliment
my dreadlocks

I wonder
what do you want?

cigarettes? sorry I don't smoke.
money? I have a couple bucks
you can have
I guess
a ride? I don't have a car
I walked
my phone? dead
weed? not on me no
my pen? but it's my last one!

you though,
I think all you wanted was conversation
a friend

so hard to come by!
in this introvert world
where a grin seems suspicious
the world is so quiet
no matter how loud
it is

it's sometimes like
I'm a hushed sanctuary
abandoned by what's
holy

it's sometimes
loud, clanking loud,
so I escape
within

it's sometimes,
I think,

and the light of a waking world.

I was submerged. (It seemed so long

that I forgot the taste of arid earth.)



I am spat out.

Tethered to the braying of

the unapologetic clock.




Now to scour jagged sand

from eyelids cracked with an unfamiliar blaze

(And already I have forgot the taste

Of brine and salted blue.)
you’re nineteen years old!

get off your arse, the world owes you nothing,
and it doesn’t get any
better
than
this


they wove you futures made of gold and silver:
“you can do this. you can.”
but you didn’t
jump
high
enough


look at you now; some shitty college and you’re on the dole,
your family have stopped
looking with stars
in their
eyes


you’ve failed them
go ahead and cry


no one cares about the tears of the princess
who’s fallen so far off


that
gilded
throne











Tick

You were so happy as a child
You didn’t mind what was futile
Because time was not fleeting
Getting older was a good thing


Now sorrow washes over you
Like electric waters
Slowly drowning
Reaching for lost moments


Cry out without a sound
Choking on the absence of air
Like deaths gray hands
Squeezing the life out of your neck
Squeezing drops out of your gaze


That tick tick tick
Slamming away
Crashing relentlessly
Ringing around your head


The darkness may be behind you
Isn’t that where you fear it most?
It sinks inside you
So numbing…


There is such a peace
When the beast shows his face
You are no longer afraid
You now know your place


But you’re still scared
You still ache
Because you haven’t been taken
That fear
Is the reason you can’t escape
how every guy I meet
ends up falling for me after a single conversation.
I tried to explain that words are power,
and if you use the right ones,
you can topple an empire.


Drink after drink, bottle after bottle,
I stumble and stutter, bitch and moan
As everyone around me continues to groan.

My morning begins with a bottle of Jack,
A few shots of vodka for my afternoon snack.
For lunch, my liquor is just as hard,
And dinner, whatever, it’s a wildcard.

My kidneys are shot and so is my liver,
All day long I shake and shiver,
If I don’t get my fix, and get it quick.
This is just one habit I can’t seem to kick.
square shoulders angled
along with spine
and the skirtwrapped
triangle of her pelvis

hair up, fingers curled
beneath ear,
right hand clasping device
until she stands, stretches
leaning against the counter
beside the foggy dawnlit

Tear me up and you'll find blood and guts aplenty

Ask me how I feel and I'll say ""empty"".




But how can you be empty? Feeling a feeling is being.

You're not empty you're whole as the earth.

Look I know it's hard, you're hurt.

If you're empty, refill.

You don't run out of gas and say ""Well that's it""

Run off to a dealership, plans in hand

About what you plan to do with your life,
At what point you plan to find yourself a wife.
Save your mother and I from strife.


We need to talk about: drugs, thugs
Benzedrine, amphetamines,
The dangers of underage drinking,
The wonders of conformist thinking.


Stay away from: Inappropriate Joking,
Excessive Smoking,
Emotion Evoking,
and Masturbatory Choking.

I have been consumed by a terrible malaise,
It has crept upon me and entwined itself around me like a vine,
And within its constriction I am helpless,
Doomed to become part of the foliage,
My heart still beats, and my heart still yearns,
Yet all I can do is watch from within my prison,
For I have the most debilitating of ailments,

I am it, and it is me,

Sometimes

When the evening air blows by me

As I sit, alone, on this porch

I remember your smell

The thought of which

Wakes me at times

And then

Like the wind


I said the building's really tall

You said jump don't think about the fall

I said I'm afraid of heights

You said have fun and enjoy the ride

I said I don't think I can do it

You said there's nothing to it

I said I'd crash when I land

You said not if you take my hand

So I jumped

I fell

I crashed

I was broken

I was shattered

I was trashed

And when I called to you for help

You proved to me that I'm by myself

So when people ask why I don't answer

love's call

I explain to them my fear of the fall


We have lain on sodden banks,
Glaring, detached from rain lashing at our chest.
Looming, the abyss of rolling thunder.
Clouds part freeing rays from God,
A warmth surpasses the cool of our skin.
Yet we have lain on sodden banks,
Dank the grass, the mud imprinted with sin.


Threadbare as we watch. Our minds puddled.
The tailor weaves his magic,
Like the sly Wizard he seems,
A swatch of stolen fabrics.
""We reap what we sow"", we have been told.
Stolen by no man but ones full of anguish, How is he to know?
When only we had dipped our toes in.


Frozen, inside.
Frozen.
The window, the pieces of our broken mirror.
Your porcelain face seemingly perfect amongst the cracks.
Mine, the reflection of scrutiny, but a minor.
My reflection? Like an entombed doll from Russia.
Tiny. Nearly forgotten, yet amongst the belly of this beast,
Lies the figure who'll fight to push her.


Freed from within, the footsteps are silent, still dank.
Like unspoken caws from the Crow,
Dark, mysterious, scheming.
Loosely perched, a false reality.
Imprints nearing full, but not stagnant.
Knowledgable, caring, pleasing.
A black feather nestles gently on the bank.
Dank the grass, the mud imprinted with faith.


Salutations for the Wizard and his mysterious bird.
Cut into halves, the garment be strewn with passion.
Like a quilt once yanked from the beds forbidden side,
Seemingly fit for only but one,
Instead like a silk pair of gloves,
A truer reality to come,


Tis fit for the hands of a Murder.

or else my mind might never get it,
How Death is so out of my station for me to continue fretting
Over the miles of sea I’ll never see;
Just because one day my ship will flip,

And maybe that is a valid concern,
Maybe I should want to keep my feet at stern,

But it’s not my decision,

It is the sea’s,
It is the moon’s,
It's the mighty bird chirping a croon;

One night I’ll fall
Deep and fast,
But right now I’m still sailing;
Just remember,
Please,

Darkness calls in deep silent sleep
Calling and calling to come to the tree
Where branches sway, no children play
In the cold wet night of fall


Dead leaves hang from the old oak tree
Climb up top for all to see
Calling and calling for you to fall
Unreachable ground at the end of it all


All the kings horsemen could not see
Would not look, would not plea
Get down or else it’s the end of it all
To you I dash, to me Death crawls


See him run, hear him plea
Pull out a knife to set me free
Ruins near, to me Death crawls
Hidden away, the light withdrawal


One night lost, one night free
One more night at the hanging tree
Hidden away, the light withdrawal
Nightmares choke, an unconscious brawl


Falling from the hanging tree
Calling and calling to climb and be free
Life and death, immortal brawl
Fathers weep and mothers bawl


There is no hope at the end of a rope.

There seems to be an insect in my drink,
It is a fruit fly of some sort, I think.
I’ll have to go empty it in the sink,
But as I get up, he throws me a wink.

Did this fruit fly really just wink at me?
There it goes again! Acting so friendly.
Perhaps he wants to live, a final plea.
Only a winking fly, why not go free?

So I walk to the door and let him go,
He zooms round, a delightful toandfro.
And I cry farewell, though tears I forgo,
We all have secrets, all have shame.
We try to disguise, try to abstain, but
















Forever they may remain a reminder.








Tho a mark still to force remembrance, still somehow forgotten.













as a box of old Christmas lights,

The grayness of my eyes

I'm always looking up at you

And you seem to always be looking down

The defeat entangles me

Pushing me closer to despair

Subtle in suffocation

Your quiet fingers

Slip around my heart

Crushing whatever I had left of me

I am a withered soul

But that's the way you love me

Habitually used until only

Your disappointment in me remains

Scarring my hands, my eyes, my mind

I am constantly reliving the way

laying down and
waking up
I lived the life I always wanted.

I just wish it were the other way around.



When I think of all the hours I’ve spent

Just listening to your voice.

Late at night, with work in sight,

I always made the choice

To drink another witty word,

Inhale a heav’n of reason.

Now here you are at Winter’s door,

Not fitted for the season.


Your eyes, they make fair Phoebus

Quite spiteful of their glint.

You are, to me, just like the orb

That shames my clumsy flint.

But the sparks I have made earnestly –

So often made with ire –

Were to give thanks, and praise you, Hitch,

i look around a crowded subway train
and part of my mind
that had been elsewhere
awakens
and for a brief moment
i am exactly where i am
present and aware
and i can't help but think,

hanging

in the abscesses of my mind
for a slight drizzle
and try to remember if the bar is left or right.

I slow down, pulse first,
then tongue and eyes.
Everything grey.

It’s as though I’m watching a lifeless world crumble
Mountains curling up with the wind.
Ice balding off peaks.

And the sediment slowly collects,
1310337253.0,17,self.Poetry,ilwa4,"∞
Standing in a pool of your secondhand showerwater,
I breathe in deep the smell of your conditioner
And imagine it running down the back of your thigh.


It was then, in the steamywhite mists of my
Daydream that I caught it in the corner of my eye:
Your message on the glass, brought out like invisible ink.


You'd drawn our heads in a bow,
Two circles touching, each with an arrow and a label;
One is you and one is me.


I imagine you drawing it
With your finger and
I trace it with my own,
Fascinated as I fall from my hair
To your chin
Over
And over
And
Over.
if the reason for most of the world sadness
is that they still make single beds for adults
not only is it a bit pitiful
but it is also expected
that for the next wee while
the occupier will probably be alone.
cuddling up in a single bed
may be nice sometimes
but if there were much chance of that happening often
the owner would probably upsize

As for me
I have a king single
I may be alone

Feeling guilty about sadness.

Chances of getting to live are very low,

Chances of being the sperm that survives,

The sperm that’s born in America,

The welloff sperm.

I never asked to exist,

Now I have to,

My responsibility,

Relationships I can’t abandon.

I do like it most the time.

Vaginas and music,

Little illusions created to make me stay.

I’m lucky to see the illusions,

It’s better than nothing.

Or maybe not,

I know nothing.

But I like vaginas and music.
not broken
You've reiterated
""A broken window needs replacing""
and I do not need replacing.
I need a good cleaning.
And while I appreciate the effort,
the smell of Windex still fills the air.
It seems you want less to ""clean me up""
and more to see the streaks
you leave behind as proof that you've
made an effort.
I do not mean to sound so ungrateful,
but I never asked for it.
""You don't appreciate it.""
I do.
And I suppose I am not in the position
to make demands,
but I'd appreciate it next time
if you'd just use newspaper
instead of toilet paper.
I don't need proof,
I don't need streaks,
and I certainly don't need

you could get a good nights sleep,

cause I don’t really need that hand,

and it’s been around longer than you have anyway.

It’s early, and the the day’s

still on the darker side of dawn

but rising,

and I hope you’re falling

deeper into love with me because I gave you the bed

when you couldn’t sleep.

I don’t want to be up this early but I might as well be,

reading other peoples poetry

and hating myself for doing less.

But that’s probably just the capitalist inbreeding in me

America’s all about,

making the sheep compete for the shepherd’s attention

when we’re all marching toward oblivion.

I’d cut my eyes out if it meant you wouldn’t have to watch me die,

cause we’re all getting there

and I don’t want to be late.

Everyone has something to say

but it’s usually not important,

and I still like my news imported.

I get overthrown by monotony

and depressed when I’m all alone.

And I think if I found out there was no point to life

I might just keep going anyway,

because it’s better than nothing.

You wanted to do something romantic tonight

and my first thought was the zoo,

which is probably wrong,

but I’ll try my best.

It’s getting brighter,

and I would’ve watched the sunrise


Purplegreen waves emanate from the trees birds &amp; moss, clouds

grass &amp; rocks,

Synchronizing with the rapidfiring synaptic jolts pulsing in

delightful ecstasy at the rate of twelve realizations per minute.

The call of birds has changed, transfigured into sweet laughter,

The air itself becomes palpable, vibrating with newfound life,

And the swaying of trees is but an invitation to join them

In their primeval bliss.

I lay down in the grass and spread my arms like wings,

Riding the soft hum of the river back to the ocean,

entwined in time
a symphony of
forgotten minds
the heroes rise
the heroes fall
earth reclaims
its stolen walls
beast again
will reign supreme
defeated dams
let loose their stream
skies regain
their former grace
when we destroy

free of charge

took my body, my heart and my soul.



i woke up empty one morning

with nothing to show for it

accused you of stealing from me.



i gave myself to you

in exchange, you left me


I don't either

I'm fucking lost

and confused

and reaching out for

the past

To hold me and to

fix me

as if I had a broken cog
So that I can start ticking

in an endless loop again

Instead of stuck

waiting for you
to come back

I guess right now,

I make a better

Compass

Than a clock

I grasp at what is just out of frame, hark I beg of you, what is in a name?

Or ambivalent sum, divided, side by side
blissfully ignorant to implications they provide.

Measuring not the will, love, or work of a ""man"",
yet they burn in my mind as they dance in quick sand.

A story as old as both space and time,
Apollo and Dionysus, one prevails in due time.

For the heart wants what the body craves
But also you
With you there should be me
And me with you
Without you there might be me
But not the same me
The me with you is better than me
While the you without me might still be
You are you with or without me
While me without you is not to be
If just me I don't know who
But you and me teaches me who
Who to be, who is me
Who are you without me
The same you you’ll always be
as your cold stare reflected off the table glass
through which I could see your hand silently load
bullets labeled insecure, unreasonable, untrusting

Fervently, I pleaded, hoping your mind would change
remember better days, search for lost love’s remains
but hopelessly your hand raised and released tension
the bullet inched deeper with every word mentioned

You left as I lay in my pool of my broken dreams
brushing off tears, convinced I’m better off, just me
lifted my defeated body, cleanse my wound with gin
I placed on the first bandaid to keep the blood within

As the pain deepened, I could no longer be patch by lies
bandaids of friends, apathy, and family constantly reapplied
hundreds of bandaids later, the wound still hasn't healed
but here I am, placing on the next hoping that it heals

the inside

of your leg

that I never noticed

until

the night you drank to much

and passed out on the floor

and even though I was drunk

and you tell me different

I do notice things

Do you?

and leave home before you wake, i wonder...
what is it that makes me return home to you?
i could easily escape from this, walk away...
but the truth is, i don't have the right shoes

this week's poem by spookinzack


Most animals feel shyness
as strongly as I do.

I think butterflies
are in fact as social as we say
since there are so many fat frogs.
Even tigers and eagles hide

in the trees, and smart fish
never stop swimming.

Still, it's comforting
to know that
any problems I face
have already been solved

by any number of teeth
and hide.

And anytime I have
trouble finding the words,
I shouldn't worry.

There will always be someone

He was drunk, bottle of whiskey in his hand singing lullabies, gun in his lap.

Grim as Job, he was crying

like a junkyardghostie.

I heard the prayers he put on vibrate causing earthquakes in his pocket

He gave me a shot

it was warm.




I sit at night in my padded cell

And all I see is blue

I am nobody

I have everything I need

But nothing that I want

I am nobody

I pretend to be happy

As I just float on through

I am nobody

As sure as the stars shine above

I will sit here blinded by myself

I am nobody

I bang at a blue brick wall

Knowing it will never break

I am nobody

I’ve sat here as kings have been crowned

And nothing has changed

I am nobody

People surround me

People who are somebody

But I am nobody

I sit with the light in my face waiting for the day

When the others take off their blinders, to see what I see

I am nobody

I am a masochist

I enjoy the pain I inflict on myself

I am nobody

I sit at night in my padded cell

And all I ever, ever see is blue

I am nobody

she parts her pack to go out alone

footprints she’ll leave but none shall know

from birth she was to be all on her own


seeking, searching for sustenance and such

taunts from hares made her mind become unfurled

the prey, so close but evading her clutch

giving up, around an oak tree she curled


What haunted her most was her blood stained maw

no wolf left to witness the morbid scene

crimson on the ground and stained on her paw

sad eyes had lost their glorious gold shean


solemn about the loss of foe and friend

snapping and circling
like wild dogs at the heels of the world.

Sword and shield are drawn,
metal armour worn, loosely;
it itches him when its fastened.

His horse is stomping up the golden wheat
in restless agitation, scared of the storm;
an unseen farmer will later sigh
at the damage to his crops
but now, rain is pouring down
and the trumpeter is calling,
the farmer is hiding somewhere up the mountain
holding his daughter, and praying,
praying to a voyeur god to save his land
while his eldest is counting the time between
flash and thunder.

The knight fastens the straps on his armour,
winces at the familiar itch, and then forgets it
falls to the ground, hit by lightning.


Anything
That wouldn't split
Like the seam in a silence
Of thread I can't sew back
I might say sorry

If I could say
Sorry
And it wouldn't break
Like a second in the sand
Of a heavy hand too late
I might be happy

If I could be
Anything
That wouldn't crumble
Like a want in the sun
Of a mirror's wish to be humble
I might be dreaming

If I could paint
A dream
So it would set me free
Like a picture broken plea
Of a dragon for its chains
I'd leave it be

If I could
I'd leave it be
If I could
To drink and smoke
Until it kills me
Or I go broke
For it is better to seek peace
At the bottom of a bottle
Than at the end of a rope
And this daily battle
By the skin of my teeth
I do berate
Hoping to escape defeat
In a check or stalemate
And break the deceit
In the words and glances


[didn’t care]


but anyway

repeated the line

as many times as

she called for it


[which was often]


I liked the sound

of your voice

and soft

flitter of your

hips into me



I had said straight

faced in the dark


[meant that]


Your memory was

a deleted text

message that;

like a dead body

still existed for

eternity in electrons

and protons


[probably]


I didn’t fail physics

I actually did quite well

I may


be a writer but

I’ve always had an affinity

for science.

She keeps asking

There is some unthought of way,
of the men we
have all taken part
in killing

watching,
the hardened bottom
of my shoe's heel
dig into the pavement
and I am happy that there
is still time
for going insane

You are given murder.
Repetition teaches: believe in God
for he is not yourself
They taught you,
your hands are for making machines

I wake on a couch
or on a floor
or in a bed;
anywhere.
And the music plays:
So you think you can tell?

The door is locked to the room
my onetruelove is burning inside of.
Through the keyhole, I am watching.
I love the way she burns;
so beautifully on fire.
I feel so far away.
My hair, my face, my hands
They are all his.
My body does not belong to me,
For inside there is another,
And he is always near.
I want to be alive today,
Lost in the sunshine and the scent of wind.
I want to dance and spin,
In  body that is mine.
I want to live without fear of him,
Always close, always creeping.
I want my own place,
A place in which to stay.
I want to live somewhere,
Somewhere where he is never near.
I saw two bottles of shaving gel

Next to each other by the sink

Blue and Orange. And foam
Between their mouths

I dried myself and opened the door

The knob turned slowly in my gentle hands
Surely Erotic

I turned the lights off
And for a moment
Fucked you in my mind

But I usually forget to turn the lights off
So before getting out
Using different coloured markers for each word
And she called it ""Love""
Because she loved him
Though they never really spoke
Except that one rainy day in the classroom
When he asked to borrow her pencil
(She never threw that pencil away)

He recieved a strange poem on white piece of paper
With colourful words and hearts in the spaces
And it was titled ""Love""
Though he didn't know why
For they never once spoke
But the poem was well written
So as he passed her in the hall, he said thank you
(He never threw that poem away)

She wrote a thoughtful poem on a yellow piece of paper
Using cursive she learnt back when she was younger
And she called it ""Questions""
Because she was full of them
For they never really spoke
Since he was so shy
That he would hurry home before they could talk
(She always remembered where he lived)

He recieved a folded poem on a yellow piece of paper
Written in handwriting he couldn't read
Except for the title, ""Questions""
Which he didn't understand
For they never once spoke
Since she was so strange
That she would follow him home from school each day
(He always remembered where she hid)

She wrote a single sentence on a lined piece of paper
Written in capital letters to try and make a point
And it said ""TALK TO ME""
Because she felt so alone
For they never really spoke
Even though she loved him
And she just wanted someone to love her back
(She never forgot that feeling)

He was passed a stupid note on a crumpled piece of paper
People giggled as he opened it up
And it said ""TALK TO ME""
Which made him mad
For they never once spoke
And he didn't understand her
So he called her a freak
(He never forgot that feeling)

She wrote an angry poem on the dusty bathroom wall
In blood dripping from her shaking wrists
And she called it ""Goodbye""
Though it wasn't really goodbye
For they never really spoke
So there never was hello
And now there never will be
(She really loved her poems)

He heard about a girl who died inside her bathroom
And he never felt so bad
'Cause he never said goodbye
Though it wasn't really goodbye
For they never once spoke
And now he spends all day
Writing poems to repent
(He really loved her poems)
clawing at the raw immensities between your fragile lidded eyes
by chance, i fell
into the crevices of oblivion
embraced by the quiet hesitance
molasses, pitch
in the last syllables so that I may
draw them out for you to linger here for hearing?


I am tired of speaking
as if my tongue knows of education
It has only been educated
by places kept private and
the tough circumstance of growing


I could be less eager
to welcome semantics and more eager
to banish it
I hold it close like a lover
and spit in its face with scorn


What of semantics?
Of poetry?
Of sentences thrown together by
the grinding teeth of youth?


I wanted to be young but
all I got was old
You’re never going to fool me
with a prank
Of the world.  You are
Smooth as looseleaf.  I would like
To fold you eight ways



And file you in my wallet.
You would find warmth among
My Visa and forgotten
Subway sandwich punchcards.



I could stow you behind my driver’s license.

I often question my favorite day of the year

Some might say holidays, with festivals and cheer

Others think of birthdays for presents and such

But what’s worth a card without any touch?




No… this date must be sacred and more than just lust

Celebrated before us, and long when we’re dust





A day of pure light, where the sun seems to stall

Today’s summer solstice is my favorite of all




But still.. it can be longer, and brighter somehow

If you would just marry me right here and right now.




smoothed my pain,

like just the warmth from whisky

not the swallow, not the bite,

not even the glass on the table

I learned how to pray

inside libraries rumbling

from his chest into temples

in his throat and lost civilizations

across the end of his tongue

His lips parted

oceans in my heart,

poured peace through

my ribs like holy silk, spun

stained glass doves into

seaweed threaded sages

who smiled like the answer

He sang his last hallelujah

and the space of silence between his

mouth and our hands, was the world

turning to remind us

that we are only cracked



You are a hyperbole.
An overestimation of I.
Three letters, You, Oh,
why do You get three letters,
While I only one?
It's as if You is more important
than I.
It's amazing how words
seem to carry so much content,
but the moment I hear
you say “I have cancer,
probably melanoma,
likely to be terminal”
all those phrases,
sayings and spiritual layers
vanish


It's as if those three letters
You, Why, Oh well,
since when did I need
more to be enough,
But if you had more years
because,
what you've had
surely ain't enough.


Why don't I give you my eye.
Seeing with one is enough.
looking like a pirate could be fun.
I don't need an eye for my I,
If you had three,
maybe they'd have seen,
that black spot that sits
perched between your wings.
It was benign this whole time,
they, said so.


They have four letters,
that's one more than you
and four fold next to I.
Them, their, fuck
has four letters,
maybe that's one too much


Why don't you give me that O,
I'll take it off your back
if you're willing.
My load has been light
and my wings are spread wide
there's space between them.
I'll take it if you're willing.


If you recall,
that day when I and he,
we were playing and eating
Lego blocks, star wars and Pokemon cards
I choked. I ran to you,
and two brief Heimlich's later
you saved my life,
and I left you a lump.
It was Oh shaped.
You took it and didn't complain.


But me, he and you
we were happy,
...we only has two letters,
Yet You have three,
Why, do you have cancer?
Oh, how I love
You.
how about you give me back my Oh
When I lay alone at night
Because I know that I need something
To wrap my arms around so tight
Because sometimes I need
Something that feels right
Like wishing you were there
By my side every night

I sometimes drink dirty water
To drown my desperate thoughts
Treat the idea like lumber
And hope it finds a way to rot
Because sometimes I just need
To release what I have got
Like the idea in my mind of you
That is plaguing all my thoughts

I sometimes go for long walks
To escape from the cold pain
Don’t care if it’s in sunshine
But I prefer the thunderous rains
Because sometimes all my tears
Need to flow downhill with the grain
When my rotted memories
Bring back moments of the pain

I sometimes feel saddened
That I might never see you
That I never have actually said
That my mind thinks that it loves you
Because sometimes you know I’ve got
To let my feelings rule
And I need you to know right this moment
of my coffee cup
in the sunlight
at eight in the morning
rises and disappears
like the woman in the black dress
she wore the night before,
her hair in a quick bun
and her stilettos feeling
out of place.
It's much too early
for dancing shoes, but



she makes her way
down my sidewalk,
past my kitchen window,
and the dots and dashes
of her hurried stride
surely spell something significant
for listeners willing to translate.



I know it's not really smoke,
but steam,
and it's not really disappearing,
but simply changing
under the influence
of the elements.

twelvefooter, impressively
layered in glitter, I wouldn't know
but I believe her, sure.

She used to be a mermaid
and before that, a woman.
That's how she knows
how to use a telephone.

The water is treating her great,
tropics, coral, you know
I wonder which way the
water flows; she tells me of course.

About land? Well, it's still dry
but there's a few things that I like
about that.
She's smiling her wry fish smile

which hasn't changed in the slightest.

But it's so nice to smoke here and pretend

that every ounce of nicotine romance

will stay with me until the bitter end.

The gentle embers warm my heart and soul

and swirl about the autumn sunset sky.

For a few hours my emptiness is whole,

filled by my lover's lovely, lovely, high.

She's dangerous, this girl, but does she know

I hold her cancer in between my lips?

For once her high is through I'm left alone

in longing for another ember kiss.

I'm terribly in love, but I don't know

with whom her heart lies. How she kills me so.


Fear when you were young
It was the monster in the dark
The spider on the porch
The bees nest in your yard
The thought of being left alone in a crowded room
The guilt of misbehaving
Your parents judgement too

With age comes understanding
It dissolves these fears
But it breeds contempt and friction
With every passing year

Now we fear ideas and concepts
Bills you cannot pay
A child you cannot raise
The thought that your life is insignificant
Nothing special though to say

air I can’t taste?

Who 'could be so beautiful'
I had to develop a personality
Had to become funny and likeable
Had to perfect the art of the oneminute introduction
And I am not lovely
I am personable
I am not the ingénue
I am the character actress
I will say ""yes.""
That is what separates us from the pack.
We will say ""yes.""
And we will make jokes at our own expense
We will learn to laugh when someone pokes our bellies
We will flirt without fear
Because we've already been shot down so many times
That what is one more rejection?
We will live life like others cannot
Full of reckless abandon
And joy and fun and laughter
Because the quickest way to learn to not give a fuck
Is to be one of us
For we have been so downtrodden
We have been so shamed
That we've grown callouses on our BMIs
And if you call me fat,
I will laugh and say, ""Obviously.""
Darling, if you wear your pain like armor
No one can use it to hurt you
And in the end, we will all be the same
And we will all feed worms
To put like words in combination,
To put them all now in relation,
This little thing of my creation.


So I've succumbed to fascination,
My pen proceeds to battle station,
My mind should act with inspiration,
To this semantic application.


On page it now has preservation,
Inside it gains appreciation,
When fears receive exoneration,
When thoughts in words provide elation.


This may put you into sedation,
You may not feel the same sensation,
But this is my infatuation,
With words in certain presentation.


They have no real implication,
And thus they hold no expectation,
But they lead one into contemplation,
A poem of sorts, an exploration.


Small verses with no elongation,
Can lead to quiet desperation,
But fear ye not the limitation,
Of this, my wordy incantation.


I write to relay information,
Without any consideration,
To a critic's choice of condemnation,
Of a poem that's built on no foundation.


Some say, ""What's this abomination?"",
""This work needs expert reparation"".
But give it not your restoration.
For rhyme is poets’ respiration.


It merely is an explanation,
To ease poetic trepidation,
But lead you not into temptation,
To find some phoney imitation.


Enjoy this drawn out innovation,
A simple, curious observation,
And treat it not with indignation,
For lacking perfect punctuation.


This leaves me near the culmination,
A stream of thought, imagination,
Like stars within a constellation,
United whilst in segregation.


And so ends this investigation,
While not without exasperation,
Has helped me in my navigation,
Upon his cheek falls a tear,
The barman asks, “what is wrong son?
Why so blue? Your life has barely begun”
The soldier fiddles with the medals upon his breast,
Then replies. “Cobber, my mate that I knew best,
Just an hour ago was laid to rest.
In my 20 years I have loved and lost,
And by my side my mate paid the ultimate cost,
In my short time I have experienced more than most,
Fought a war in a foreign land, on a foreign coast,
How could you claim my life has barely started,
When so many of my mates have, of this earth, departed?”
And with that he stood and said “goodbye”
As the other patrons began to cry,
but I sorted that cocksucker out
with an aluminum tube.
She's dead now,
on the floor.
and no one will ever know
that I killed her.

I'm sure something or someone else
will take her place,
something more vicious
someone more sly.

But until then
I sharpen my nails
and polish my bullet
and wait.

I'm not quiet done with her yet,
nor her with me.
and even over loud traffic
or a sad song
I can still hear
Nails dig into the skin.
Inside the mind a somber voice rasps
Not to move an inch.


Hands are shaking
Palms are wet
Skin grows damp
With beads of sweat.

Everyone is afraid of something
No one had nothing to fear.
Standing, waiting, and listening,
Terrified of what you might hear.

A child fears the things that come out
When the sun has gone to bed.
She lays awake for hours,
Monsters running through her head.

A parent fears for their little girl,
Knowing that one day
The monsters all will leave her head
And worse things will move in to stay.

In an uninterrupted sea which bleed into the sky she stood

the only thing blocking my view

and I couldn’t care.



Eyes as deep as the undisturbed night sky


And once again I fell in

pulled under the riptide of beauty.


With her broken english and my pocket


that book: Like the Fallen Leaves

remember it?

the one we had to read Sophomore year?

you remember,

it was the one with the red cover with the gold inlay.

I was so happy when you said you would be my partner,

though I made sure not to show it,

I remember us in the library during lunch

you were wearing that sundress and you still had that short hair,

the book was old so it drew my attention,

we read a bit of it and you said it was okay,

do you remember how we would sit so close?

In class, when we were analyzing the poems inside?

We were so close,

though I pretended to be distant,

do you remember how we would take so long at the library?

How I would stall with tangents?

Just so we could spend more time,

together,

I remember how you weren't going to be in class the next day,

you said you had a doctors appointment,

do you remember that?

I remember how because I had one the next day I left you a note,

saying how we should get some ice cream after school the next day,

to celebrate the end of the analyzing,

remember how I slipped it in the book?

Page 86,

I remember how exited I was that you wrote yes,

in those little loops that are your 'O's,

do you remember driving home that day?

Do you remember the intersection?

Do you remember the red light?

Do you remember you not seeing it?

Do you remember the semitruck?

Do you remember impact?

I remember when I heard the next day,

I remember not hearing the words at all,

having Jane tell me again,

tell me that you were dead,

I remember that I broke down,

I remember the looks from those around me,

I remember when it came out,

that I liked you,

I remember not being in school for a while,

afterwords,

I remember that when I got back the book was back on the shelf,

I remember taking it with trembling hands,

and teary eyes,

I remember flipping through the old pages,

I still remember the smell,

I always will,

I remember finding the note,

still inside,

I remember that I would come back to it,

to the book,

every now and again,

just to see the note,

I remember it not being there one day,

I remember asking the librarian,

I remember her saying that she had thrown it away,

I remembered that I never removed the note,

it seemed wrong to do so,

so here I am now,

senior year is ending soon,

and I have one more final before I'm done,

I bought a new copy of that book,

I donated it to the library,

I came back the next day,

and it was where the old one was,

I'm placing this letter inside,

on page 86,

this shelf will always be a memorial,

at least to me,

I promise that,

that I will come back,

and I will stand:

here,

and I will read this note,

and talk to you again,

but now I have to go take my last final,

my poetry final.

I love you.
